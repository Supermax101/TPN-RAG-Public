The Acid-Base Disorders document defines metabolic alkalosis and describes its compensation. The document also provides the diagnostic criteria. In metabolic alkalosis, the primary disturbance is elevated bicarbonate (HCO3-) and increased pH. The body attempts to compensate by retaining CO2 to bring the pH back toward normal. This is achieved through pulmonary mechanisms. The pulmonary system compensates for metabolic alkalosis by decreasing the respiratory rate, which leads to CO2 retention and therefore an increase in pCO2. This respiratory compensation helps counterbalance the elevated pH by adding more acid (CO2) to the system. The document clearly states the compensation mechanism and direction of pCO2 change.
