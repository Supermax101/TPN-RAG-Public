An exclusive fish oil product (Omegaven®) is available in the United States under compassionate-use and research protocols only. It usually is given in combination with other lipid emulsions to provide a more balanced mix of fatty acids. n-3 fatty acids or very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA) such as DHA have beneficial effects on the developing brain and retina and may be considered conditionally essential in preterm infants. Studies have demonstrated that the use of the fish oil emulsion can reverse or at least ameliorate hepatic dysfunction in infants and children with PNALD, but the quantity of fish oil emulsion required has not been determined, and variation in response among large numbers of subjects remains untested. Answer A is incorrect. Lipid emulsions, derived mainly from soybean and safflower oil, contain neutral triglycerides, glycerol, and phospholipids for emulsification. The most commonly used emulsion in the United States is soybean oil derived. It has no DHA and little alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E, as an antiinflammatory substance), and it contains medium chain fatty acids and large amounts of phytosterols. Answer B is incorrect. Phytosterols have been associated with Kupffer cell activation and inflammation, leading to hepatic injury and cirrhosis. Their elimination from nonsoybean oil IV lipid emulsions may be as or more important in preventing or ameliorating PNALD than the benefits assumed for fish oil and other short (oleic) and long chain polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (specifically, DHA) or antiinflammatory substances such as alpha-tocopherol. Answer D is incorrect. It is weighted to linoleic n-6 long chain fatty acids, producing a higher n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio. Mixed soybean, olive, and fish oil–based emulsions containing medium chain fatty acids, alpha-tocopherol, significant amounts of DHA, and decreased amounts of n-6 PUFAs are available in Europe, and one has recently been introduced in the United States (Smoflipid®). It does contain phytosterols but in amounts much lower than the exclusive soybean oil product.

Maintaining sufficient protein and energy intake and meeting the needs for metabolism and growth are essential, but individual nutrients should be adjusted to ensure normal plasma nutrient and metabolic product concentrations. Answer A is incorrect, because this will lead to under nutrition as donor milk does not have sufficient protein to maintain normal protein balance and promote growth if IV amino acid infusion rates are decreased too quickly. Not uncommonly, PN is often reduced abruptly to allow for removal of central lines or because of poor peripheral IV access. However, this can produce a period of several days when there is inadequate protein and energy intake. Answer C is incorrect. Some clinicians have raised concerns about the adverse effects of higher early amino acid infusion rates on neurodevelopment because of the possibility of causing hyperaminoacidemia, metabolic acidosis, uremia, and hyperammonemia, but most studies have not shown such adverse outcomes. In fact, BUN concentrations and ammonia concentrations should both increase slightly with increased amino acid infusion rates if the amino acids are appropriately oxidized and producing ammonia and the liver is functioning well to remove ammonia through the urea cycle. There is little correlation between plasma BUN and ammonia concentrations and amino acid infusion rates in the acceptable range. Abnormally high amino acid concentrations generally are the result of excessive and unnecessary infusion rates (>4 g/kg/day) and limited urinary urea excretion. Caution should be used in giving high amino acid infusion rates to infants with impaired liver or renal function from hypoxic-ischemic injury that prevents ammonia detoxification by the damaged liver and urea and ammonia excretion by the damaged kidney. In contrast, the most common metabolic complication of IV amino acid solutions is lower than needed plasma concentrations of essential and some conditionally essential amino acids, as well as unbalanced amino acid concentrations, which together will limit anabolism and net protein balance. Furthermore, there are many examples of improved morbidities with optimal amino acid infusion rates. For example, a lower incidence of chronic lung disease has been reported in infants receiving higher intakes (4 g/kg/day) than in those receiving 3 g/kg/day, but whether this is due to improved lung growth directly from the amino acids or from amino acid production of IGF-1 is uncertain. Answer D is incorrect, because the protein-to-energy ratio is curvilinear; that is, there is not a fixed protein-to-energy ratio across the range of metabolizable, nonprotein energy intakes. It should be underscored that nitrogen retention increases with increasing energy intake up to about 80 to 90 kcal/kg/day, but at higher energy (caloric) intakes, there is no increased gain in net protein balance. The latter is achieved only with greater protein intakes. At low energy intakes, more energy improves protein balance, but greater amounts of energy, from both carbohydrate and lipid, above the amount needed for protein balance only contribute to greater fat accretion (see Table 6.3).", "source": "Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6", "raw_id": "13"}}

Answer B is true, as many preterm infants—especially those born extremely preterm and of extremely low birth weight—have limited lipoprotein lipase activity (and other lipases), limiting their capacity for plasma lipid clearance. Although many use an upper limit of 200 to 250 mg/dL for serum triglyceride concentrations, there is no specific pathology associated with high levels of triglycerides, and they only indirectly indicate that oxidative metabolism of fatty acids released by lipases from triglycerides might be limited. Answer C is true because IV lipids can release sufficient amounts of fatty acids that produce carbon competition with glucose for mitochondrial oxidation, contributing to hyperglycemia. Similarly, hyperglycemia from excess IV dextrose infusion rates and other processes limit fatty acid carbon oxidation and their beneficial effect on energy balance. IV lipid emulsions do not, however, contain carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), the enzyme necessary for transporting long chain fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation. Milk and preterm formulas do contain reasonable amounts of CPT, indicating that IV nutrition with lipids requires some enteral feeding to allow sufficient fatty acid oxidation for achieving positive energy balance. Answer D is true because advancing IV lipids to 3 to 3.5 g/kg/day is important for providing nonprotein calories, for achieving positive energy balance, and supporting protein synthesis and net protein balance. Answer E is true. IV lipid emulsions do not contain sufficient amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to meet normal fetal accretion of this essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA). Even fish oil–based IV lipid emulsions, which do contain some DHA, do not contain enough DHA to produce normal fetal DHA deposition rates. Fetal white adipose tissue accumulation during last trimester of n-3 fatty acid is about 45 to 65 mg/day (mostly as 22:6n-3, or DHA). A 1 kg preterm infant fed human milk containing 3.7 g fat/dL with 0.2% to 0.4% fatty acids as 22:6n-3 (DHA) at an enteral feeding volume of 180 mL/kg/day would receive only 13 to 25 mg 22:6n-3 DHA/day, clearly below normal in utero accretion rates. Preterm infants fed increased 22:6n-3 DHA may have higher visual acuity, particularly at 2 and 4 months, and improved Bayley mental development and MacArthur Communicative inventories at 12 months, but longer term studies have not shown a clear benefit to any aspect of neurodevelopment of supplemental DHA. Thus the current diet for preterm infants is deficient in this essential fatty acid, but the long-term significance of this deficiency is not known, nor is how these infants would develop if fed to sufficiency.", "source": "Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6", "raw_id": "14"}}

More recent studies reveal that starting with higher amino acid intakes of 3 g/kg/day administered in the first few days of life is safe and decreases the incidence of extra uterine growth restriction. Answer B is incorrect, because current IV amino acid solutions were not developed to provide optimal individual amino acid delivery for newborn infants, including very preterm infants, infants with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and especially infants with early postnatal physiologic and biochemical instability. Answer C is incorrect because the imbalance in plasma essential, conditionally essential, and nonessential amino acids provided in current neonatal IV amino acid solutions is not improved by simply increasing the IV amino acid intake (infusion) rate. Perhaps as a result of these limitations, there is only limited evidence that increased IV amino acid supply during the first days after birth improves growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Instead, neurodevelopment is improved when greater amounts of amino acids (and total protein when milk feedings are added) are given with higher amounts of energy, both carbohydrate and lipid. Maintaining the gestational age–appropriate protein intake supports brain growth as measured by head circumference and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, even into adolescence. Commonly accepted recommendations for preterm infants are shown in Table 6.4, although there is considerable variability among NICUs in this practice. Intakes of amino acids higher than 4 g/kg/day right after birth have not been shown to further enhance protein balance, even in extremely preterm infants born between 23 and 28 weeks' gestation who require the higher amino acid and protein intakes for optimal growth.

As such, they contain insufficient amounts of many amino acids, particularly essential and conditionally essential amino acids. It is fundamental that during fetal life, fractional growth rate and fractional protein synthetic rates, which determine amino acid requirements, decline with gestation. Fetal animal studies and the factorial method for assessing fetal protein requirements in human infants at 24 to 30 weeks' gestation show that 3.6 to 4.8 g/kg/day of amino acids support the more rapid growth at these early gestational ages. The average value of 4 g/kg/day is recommended as the guideline for infants after birth but of the same gestational age as the rapidly growing normal human fetus. At later gestational ages, less protein (amino acids) is needed; for example, 2.5 to 3.5 g/kg/day between 30 to 36 weeks and 1.5 to 2 g/kg/day at term (which is the amount provided by full breast feeding of mature mother's milk). These manufactured solutions contain essential amino acids and conditionally essential amino acids such as tyrosine and taurine. The delivery of gestational age–appropriate amounts of amino acids along with adequate energy results in positive nitrogen balance and a decrease in loss of body weight, thereby reducing time to regain birth weight. It is estimated that, in the absence of exogenous intake, endogenous protein losses are 0.5 to 1 g/kg/day for infants receiving only dextrose in the infusion. Protein should provide 8% to 10% of total calories; providing more than 10% of the gestational age–appropriate amount of protein is unnecessary and does not increase net protein accretion or body growth rate.", "source": "Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6", "raw_id": "16"}}

These rates provide 30% to 50% of total caloric intake if no enteral feeding is provided. IV dextrose above these rates is the principal cause of neonatal hyperglycemia, but other conditions contribute to this problem, making it common. Many of these infants also have stress-induced catecholamine, cortisol, and glucagon surges that suppress insulin secretion and promote glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis and reduce peripheral insulin and glucose sensitivity. Excessive dosing of IV lipids also aggravates hyperglycemia by providing competitive lipid carbon for oxidation and by producing cofactors in the liver from beta-oxidation of fatty acids that promote the regulatory enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway. Most preterm infants and term infants continue to produce glucose from their liver at about 2 to 3 mg/kg/min. Furthermore, hepatic glucose production, even in preterm infants, is not easily suppressed by high glucose or insulin concentrations. If the parenteral dextrose infusion rate is .5 to 7 mg/kg/min, then total glucose utilization capacity will be exceeded, resulting in progressively increasing glucose concentrations. Increasing glucose infusion rate (GIR) above 8 to 10 mg/kg/min almost always contributes to hyperglycemia, which has many adverse consequences, including increased CO2 production, lipogenesis, and development of a fatty liver with inflammation and steatosis. Glucose intolerance can occur in preterm infants even at a GIR of 6 mg/kg/min or lower, especially when glucose is infused without amino acids. Coinfusion of amino acids can reduce glucose concentrations and the incidence of hyperglycemia, as amino acids increase insulin secretion and promote anabolism (protein synthesis and protein balance) that requires energy production from glucose oxidation. Absence of enteral nutrition also contributes to the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia by limiting production of gut incretins, which stimulate insulin secretion. Infants of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) are very susceptible to hyperglycemia, further aggravating the overall nutritional status of these fragile infants. Reducing the GIR by coinfusing a lower dextrose fluid, reducing total fluids overall, or advancing feeds are effective ways to normalize glucose levels.", "source": "Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6", "raw_id": "17"}}

The last, and most invasive option, would be a surgically centrally placed (Broviac or Hickman) catheter. Although infection risk is low, it is highly invasive with placement and removal requiring a surgeon.
