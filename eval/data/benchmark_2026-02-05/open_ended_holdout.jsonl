Cysteine is not found in commercially available amino acid products because of stability concerns. The addition of cysteine provides an added benefit of decreasing the pH of the PN solution further to allow for improved calcium and phosphate solubility. For this reason, some institutions add cysteine to PN at a ratio of 40 mg for every gram of amino acids.\nb. Heparin: Heparin is typically added at 0.25–1 unit/ml of PN solution for solutions infusing through central venous catheters (CVCs). In neonates, this process maintains the patency of the catheter, given the extremely low flow rates of these solutions and the small diameter of the catheter. Some institutions will consider removal of heparin from these solutions if the flow rate is sufficient to maintain the patency of the catheter (eg, 10 ml/h).\nc. Carnitine: Carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for oxidation and energy production and is an important addition to PN solutions for patients <32 weeks’ GA. Carnitine accrual occurs almost exclusively during the third trimester of pregnancy, so extremely premature neonates who are not receiving adequate EN are at risk for deficiency without supplementation. Carnitine is typically added to PN solutions at 5–20 mg/kg/d if no enteral intake of human breast milk or formula is provided and especially if the infant is expected to be on PN longer than 14 days.\nd. Multivitamins: Pediatric multivitamins should be included in customized PN solutions at 2 ml/kg/d for infants <2.5 kg and 5 ml/d for infants ≥2.5 kg.\ne. Trace elements: None of the currently commercially available multi–trace-element products contain the appropriate amounts of each of the standard trace elements. For this reason, the ASPEN Novel Nutrient Task Force recommendations6 for pediatric trace elements in this population is to add them as individual components as follows (see also Appendix B, Table B-25). Note that more recent European recommendations supported by ASPEN recommend slightly higher doses of zinc (500 mcg/kg/d), copper (40 mcg/kg/d), and selenium (7 mcg/kg/d) in premature infants.7 These higher amounts are starting to be used in clinical practice in the United States:\n\ni.   Zinc: 400 mcg/kg/d (if weight is <3000 g)\nii.  Copper: 20 mcg/kg/d\niii. Manganese: 1 mcg/kg/d (Note that some groups do not add manganese because of manganese contamination from other PN components, the risks of toxicity, and the lack of deficiency observed in patients.)\n iv. Selenium: 2 mcg/kg/d\n  v. No addition of chromium", "domain": "tpn", "proficiency": "hard", "source_doc": null, "metadata": {"difficulty": "Hard", "case_context": "Neonatal Case 1: 23-Week Gestational Age Neonate — DOL 2 (Day 1 PN)\"\nTask Summary,\"Covering NICU consult for 23-week GA neonate born yesterday.

Advance sodium phosphate to the recommended amount of 1 mmol/kg/d.\nSodium phosphate: 1 mmol/kg/d\nPotassium phosphate: None\nPotassium: BGJ’s potassium is WNL and is most likely lower than the actual laboratory result. This is related to BGJ now needing to have blood collected via heel sticks, given the loss of her UAC. These samples are often hemolyzed, which falsely elevates the potassium level. (Note that most laboratories indicate hemolysis of the sample within the result comments.) Given this normal value, the potential for a hemolyzed sample, and BGJ’s adequate urine output (~1.6 ml/kg/h), BGJ’s potassium in her PN solution should be increased to the standard provision of 2 mEq/kg/d. However, given BGJ’s current decreased chloride value and increased carbon dioxide value, changing from potassium acetate to potassium chloride would be recommended. Therefore, potassium should be provided as 2 mEq/kg/d potassium chloride.\nPotassium acetate: None\nPotassium chloride: 2 mEq/kg/d\nSodium: Premature infants have increased rates of sodium clearance via their urine. Additionally, they have increased sodium needs, which are not meet by breast milk. Given BGJ’s decreased sodium level, the recommendation would be to increase her total sodium to 3–4 mEq/kg/d. By increasing the sodium phosphate in the PN script, 1.33 mEq/kg/d sodium is provided by the provision of 1 mmol/kg/d sodium phosphate. The remaining 1.7–2.7 mEq/kg/d sodium should come from either sodium chloride or sodium acetate. Given BGJ’s decreased chloride value and improved carbon dioxide value, adding some sodium chloride would be appropriate, but one should not remove all the sodium acetate because premature infants have increased losses of acetate due to renal excretion.9 For this reason, the recommendation would be to provide sodium acetate at 1.3 mEq/kg/d and to add 1.4 mEq/kg/d sodium chloride to provide a total of 4 mEq/kg/d sodium.\nSodium acetate: 1.3 mEq/kg/d\nSodium chloride: 1.4 mEq/kg/d\nMagnesium: Given BGJ’s decreased magnesium level and the lack of magnesium in her current PN solution, magnesium should be added at the standard amount of 0.3 mEq/kg/d.\nMagnesium sulfate: 0.3 mEq/kg/d\nCalcium: BGJ’s calcium value is WNL and should be advanced to the recommended amount of 2 mEq/kg/d.\nCalcium gluconate: 2 mEq/kg/d", "domain": "tpn", "proficiency": "hard", "source_doc": null, "metadata": {"difficulty": "Hard", "case_context": "In the past 48 hours, BGJ has received an increase in her enteral nutrition, which consists of mother’s breast milk (MBM) with a backup of donor breast milk (DBM).

Because the plan is to reinitiate MBM/DBM at 5 ml every 3 hours at 24 hours after her last blood transfusion and advance to the goal EN volume thereafter, the need for further laboratory monitoring may not be warranted. Given BGJ’s low sodium, the recommendation is to repeat a laboratory panel (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, SCr, glucose, and calcium) after she has been weaned off PN for ~36–48 hours. If she is unable to wean off PN in the next 4–5 days, earlier laboratory testing may be warranted. Monitoring laboratory values after being weaned from PN will give the team an idea of whether she truly needs additional enteral sodium supplementation to grow adequately while receiving breast milk. Another potential option to assess sodium status may be a spot urine sodium assessment. Although this has been shown to be accurate only in surgical patients with ileostomies, it is considered a noninvasive assessment of total body sodium.
