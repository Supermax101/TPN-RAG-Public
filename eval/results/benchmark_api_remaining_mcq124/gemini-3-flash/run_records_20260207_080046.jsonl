Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W. We may infuse concentrations between D3W and D12.5W through a peripheral IV. Higher concentrations require central access. F.

In a suitably humidified environment, appropriate initial rates of IV fluid intake for the premature infant are: >28 wks gestation: 60-80 mL/kg\n26-28 wks gestation: 80-100 mL/kg\n<26 wks gestation: 100-120 mL/kg 5. These guidelines assume close monitoring of body weight, intake/output measurements, and serum sodium as noted above. 6. After the brisk diuresis that usually occurs during the first 3-7 days, urine output generally decreases to about 2-4 mL/kg/h, and fluid intake can be adjusted to about 120-150 mL/kg/d. 7. Once on full enteral nutrition, infants without evidence of CHF or renal dysfunction can almost always tolerated greater intake volumes, e.g., 160-180 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part2.md]\nlevels in utero that result in pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia.

Therefore, they may be relatively hyperinsulinemic at birth, resulting in higher than normal glucose requirements and hypoglycemia. E. Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W. We may infuse concentrations between D3W and D12.5W through a peripheral IV. Higher concentrations require central access. F.

However, until an optimal multitrace element product is developed, one mechanism for dose-adjusting trace elements based on age-specific or disease-specific needs is to supplement PN solutions with copper, selenium, and zinc using the single-entity products instead of the multitrace element products. Thus, accumulation of chromium and manganese can be avoided. For institutions using multitrace element products, supplemental zinc may be required in certain patients, such as preterm infants and those with increased GI losses. In addition, routine monitoring of copper in patients with cholestasis and of chromium and manganese in all patients is advised.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\namounts provided through contamination of other additives.

Important trace elements may also be neglected in the currently available products. Iodine, fluoride, and molybdenum are routinely supplemented in multitrace element preparations available outside the United States. Although iodine supplementation is not needed in patients on short-term PN, deficiency may occur in patients receiving chronic therapy especially since topical povidone-iodine is rarely used in dressings anymore.67 Deficiency of molybdenum has not been reported in pediatrics; however, one adult case of deficiency has been documented.47 TABLE 33-6.

Trace elements commonly added to PN solutions include zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and chromium . For term infants requiring short (ie, &lt;2 weeks) courses of PN, it may not be necessary to provide them, but they should be provided to preterm neonates upon PN initiation . In particular, zinc and copper are necessary for growth, and serious complications have been reported when they have not been provided . Table 7-17 provides the typical doses of the most commonly supplemented trace elements . Because of biliary excretion of copper and manganese, these trace elements should be reduced in patients with cholestasis . Similarly, parenteral intake of selenium and chromium should be reduced or held in cases of renal dysfunction\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Standard multitrace element products for neonates often provide manganese in","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"eca1c97cd4e911b41d2bfd70eb6f6c27f5a606b5a1e55ae573b938599a0d8f4e","retrieval_snapshot_id":"14afbde10a8344c2aab2988921d1e555","latency_ms":3422.9226112365723,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7202008273981915,"rag_context_chars":5164,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\nand generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: and generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: and generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: 1. Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\ntherapeutic doses.\n # Insulin\n\nBecause the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended.[64]\n # Special Situations therapeutic doses.\n # Insulin\n\nBecause the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended.[64]\n # Special Situations\n # Starter PN Evidence has demonstrated that early PN administration in preterm LBW neonates can improve growth and potentially neurodevelopment. Within hours of delivery, a solution of protein (as amino acids, fat [in the form of ILE], and carbohydrates [as dextrose]) is administered until a customized PN can be compounded. Also, referred to as \"vanilla bags\" or \"day of life 1 PN,\" these solutions are started soon --- <!-- Page 232 --> after birth and are intended to prevent the catabolic processes that can result in additional muscle mass loss. These solutions provide sufficient energy and protein and sufficient calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. Typical starter PNs contain dextrose, amino acids, and calcium but are free of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively.

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus. Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n\n---\n[Source: UCSF Neonatal TPN.md]\n(DOL, day of life; pulm., pulmonary; PPHN, persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn; MAS meconium aspiration syndrome) 4. **Electrolyte requirements** are stated on the parenteral nutrition order form and must be adjusted according to serum values and clinical condition.

Specially formulated amino acid blends may be extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease). To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth. Infants only provided dextrose-containing fluids would continue to break down muscle mass that is difficult to regain.

This practice has largely been abandoned because of the lack of evidence to support it and the benefits documented with early initiation of amino acids in premature infants (ie, ≥2–2.5 g/kg/d within a few hours after birth).23,24\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nnitrogen balance.

Specially formulated amino acid blends may be extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease). To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth. Infants only provided dextrose-containing fluids would continue to break down muscle mass that is difficult to regain.

Protein requirements are estimated from fetal accretion rates and the intake required to achieve a rate of growth and body composition of a fetus of similar GA.[18] The optimal protein dose and composition for PN and EN are listed in Tables 7-7 and 7-8.[19] Human milk with added human milk fortifiers and preterm infant formulas will meet protein intake goals when infants are fed at least  $120\\mathrm{kcal / kg / d}$\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nwhich prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria.

Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

This caution is emphasized in a recent ASPEN position paper.14 Often, nonprotein calories of 60 to 80 kcal/kg/d, perhaps even less, are sufficient to meet initial neonate goals.15 Documented studies indicate that preterm neonates often require a generous protein supply, perhaps as high as 4 g/kg/d, which primarily provides a substrate for tissue repair but does not independently prevent catabolism of the existing muscle mass. Counting this protein delivery as energy-yielding caloric intake may result in inadequate caloric provision; this is the basis for calculating and targeting nonprotein calories in the acute perioperative setting. To provide an optimal substrate for nutrient assimilation, a nonprotein calorie-to-nitrogen ratio of 130:1 to 210:1 is generally recommended as the target PN solution.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nwhich prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria.

A neonate is born at 28 weeks' gestational age and has poor tone and respiratory effort after cesarean delivery for maternal indications, with maternal history of preeclampsia and fetal intolerance of labor. The Apgar score is 3 at 1 minute, 4 at 5 minutes, and 6 at 10 minutes. The newborn receives positive pressure ventilation and is intubated. The blood gas shows a metabolic and respiratory acidosis. What is the current status of evaluation and practice for preterm newborns and neonatal encephalopathy? A. Although the trials are still ongoing, due to the likelihood of benefit and low risk of harm, this patient should receive therapeutic hypothermia. B.

Cord blood should be sent to test for free thyroxine as the main tool for evaluation of neonatal thyroid status.If the neonate's thyrotropin receptor antibody is greater than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , it is recommended that the neonate is kept under close observation for the first few days after birth , with particular attention paid to the heart rate and blood pressure.If the maternal thyrotropin receptor antibody has been negative , neonatal treatment with iodine should begin within the first hour while awaiting pending laboratory test results.To prevent false-positive results , laboratory testing in the neonate should be delayed for 1 to 2 weeks because serum levels of antibodies and thyroid function will primarily reflect placental passage of maternal hormones and antibodies.Regardless of the maternal history\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: In the early phase of parenteral nutrition for a V","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"0316d1a083939cd44cc80e89674d63efe10bf4b265854fbe7bdab5e62be95cb4","retrieval_snapshot_id":"b3c3af261b35464081f942f8b46a8763","latency_ms":3172.7147102355957,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.6732418949741057,"rag_context_chars":4429,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Karger AG; 2021:60-74. https://doi.org/10.1159/000514736 # Protein Needs Human milk serves as the model for determining protein needs for neonates and informs the recommended intakes for full-term infants, which are estimated at about  $1.5\\mathrm{g / kg / d}$ , but the exact requirements are not defined, given the variability of human milk composition over the course of lactation.[17] Preterm and low birth weight (LBW) infants require higher protein intake to account for the increased growth rates while also considering catch-up growth . Protein requirements are estimated from fetal accretion rates and the intake required to achieve a rate of growth and body composition of a fetus of similar GA.[18] The optimal protein dose and composition for PN and EN are listed in Tables 7-7 and 7-8.[19] Human milk with added human milk fortifiers and preterm infant formulas will meet protein intake goals when infants are fed at least  $120\\mathrm{kcal / kg / d}$\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\ncurrent practice, the focus should be on following the pattern of growth, ideally parallel to the growth chart curves, while also monitoring weight growth velocities and z score changes over time.12 ## Energy and Protein Needs\n\nTerm infants require energy and protein intakes to support optimal health, development, and a normal growth trajectory. Preterm infants require increased energy and protein intakes to account for the lack of nutrient stores at birth and accumulated nutrition deficits and to support gradual catch-up growth. Energy and protein intake needs for preterm infants are determined based on the physiologic requirements to achieve an adequate rate and composition of growth and weight gain compared with a fetus of similar size and GA.13\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: According to Avery's Neonatology, the protein requirement of a","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"6cda888307b9d29ecc12f643b083133e2be6fc6ab03a8682457a01af22e848b3","retrieval_snapshot_id":"0ad553b584ab479680314539210fe18f","latency_ms":3133.8462829589844,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.730453977581771,"rag_context_chars":5866,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: 9_AcidBaseDisorders.md]\nNUTRITION SUPPORT\nCERTIFICATE Upon admission to the hospital and continuation of PN, what change should be made based on RK's ABG? to multiple days of high volume emesis.\n- Laboratory values:\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nand the neonate will become catabolic and break down their protein stores for energy. Neonates with severe respiratory failure, congenital heart defects, or NEC often receive PN initially.66 ## Compounding PN for the Neonate In addition to the calcium and phosphorus compatibility issues, other compounding factors have been the focus of recent attention in hopes of preventing PN-related complications in the neonate. These include minimizing aluminum exposure, protecting the solutions from light, and avoidance of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate--containing materials. Preterm infants and children with intestinal failure have immature or diminished antioxidant defenses that render them more susceptible to oxidant stress that can influence the selection of many PN additives.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The neonate is a 28-week EL","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"564536057f33097a5831d700694585d2927b3188af06a7176cf154bae62bd0c9","retrieval_snapshot_id":"8c49c382c06846e9be2157cd037846af","latency_ms":3088.3922576904297,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.6580849172500779,"rag_context_chars":5411,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Expression of human milk impacts nutrients such as fat, which can be variable based on milk expression timing; vitamin C, which is vulnerable to light exposure; and bioactive ingredients, which may be diminished during freezing.112,113 Healthcare facilities should prepare, store, and deliver human milk safely to protect and preserve the milk. Accurate track-and-trace systems must also be in place to prevent incorrect administration of human milk.113,114\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby mixing each feed with an HMF or preterm formula. Clinicians should include the family when planning prescriptions. For a parent-centered algorithm to use at discharge, see Figure 11-3. ## Term Infants Hospitalized term infants often have a diagnosis that impacts nutrient requirements, absorption, and delivery. As with preterm infants, hospitalized term infants are separated from their mothers and may undergo surgery and/or intubation, which may temporarily prevent direct breastfeeding. The provision of expressed MOM is important to protect these infants from common infections in immunocompromised infants. Human milk fortification is necessary for term infants who have fluid restrictions (<140 mL/kg/d);increased energy needs (with cardiac or pulmonary disorders); andexcess nutrient losses or poor absorption from diuretic use, ostomies (colostomy, jejunostomy, thoracostomy), dialysis, cystic fibrosis, hepatic, or renal failure.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nbe required to meet the nutritional needs of this vulnerable population.

Clinical decisions to adjust the enteral feeding regimen are determined by several factors, primarily stool or ostomy output, evidence of malabsorption, and other less objective symptoms such as abdominal fullness, irritability, and regurgitation. Currently, decisions related to advancing enteral feeding, weaning PN, and long-term monitoring of patients at risk for growth failure are based almost completely on experience, tradition, and art rather than evidence-based algorithms. However, institutions have created feeding protocols to standardize their own practice with excellent results at expediting PN-weaning and reducing IF-associated liver disease (IFALD) incidence.49 The understanding of the relative importance of these factors, how they are incorporated into daily management, and how they impact adaptation in patients with IF is critical if the management of infants with IF is to move beyond art and tradition and into an evidence-based practice of medicine.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nhas been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom.

PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

PN energy needs are less likely to be increased because there is no thermic energy associated with digestion of food. PN fluid needs may be increased as per the stool or ostomy output.³\n ## Enteral Nutrition\n\nEN should be started as soon as clinically appropriate after a resection. At the very least, minimal or trophic feeds are encouraged to maintain mucosal health. Oral feeds, in small volumes, should be encouraged to maintain oral skills.\n\nHuman milk is recommended in infants because it contains immunoglobulins, prebiotics, and growth factors, which help in intestinal adaptation. Donor breast milk can be used for preterm infants under 32 weeks’ GA. If human milk is not available, formulas can be used. Amino acid-based formulas or extensively hydrolyzed formulas are\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 456 -->\n\npreferred because children with SBS absorb nutrients better if they are broken down.²\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nwhich prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria. Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? which prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria. Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

It is ordered in g/kg daily. IL-20 provides 0.2 g/mL of lipid, and 2 kcal/mL (9 kcal/g of lipid, and an additional 0.2 kcal/mL from glycerol). Thus, 0.1 mL/kg/hr delivers about 0.5 g/kg/day; 15 mL/kg/day delivers 3 g/kg/day, and 30 kcal/kg/day. Remember to wean the IL-20 as feedings advance, since fats make up most of the caloric content of milk. Once feedings of ≥ 80 mL/kg/d are achieved, the IL-20 rate should be restricted to 1 g/kg/day, and IL-20 may be stopped when feedings are ≥ 100-120 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\n: 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 : 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 Enteral feeding: 11 ml Q 3 hrs of Full strength Breast Milk/MBM\n(0.68 cal/ml) provides 67.4 Kcal/kg and 101.1 ml/kg\nTotal Kcals (all sources): 101.2 Kcal/kg\nGlucose Infusion Rate (PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium: Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride: Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr ethacin Patient Case: Day 9 to 10 TPN Ex-25w0d, birthweight 0.87 kg, RDS, PDA Parenteral nutrition therapy day # 9\nDosing weight: 0.87 kgs.

It is ordered in g/kg daily. IL-20 provides 0.2 g/mL of lipid, and 2 kcal/mL (9 kcal/g of lipid, and an additional 0.2 kcal/mL from glycerol). Thus, 0.1 mL/kg/hr delivers about 0.5 g/kg/day; 15 mL/kg/day delivers 3 g/kg/day, and 30 kcal/kg/day. Remember to wean the IL-20 as feedings advance, since fats make up most of the caloric content of milk. Once feedings of ≥ 80 mL/kg/d are achieved, the IL-20 rate should be restricted to 1 g/kg/day, and IL-20 may be stopped when feedings are ≥ 100-120 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\n: 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 : 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 Enteral feeding: 11 ml Q 3 hrs of Full strength Breast Milk/MBM\n(0.68 cal/ml) provides 67.4 Kcal/kg and 101.1 ml/kg\nTotal Kcals (all sources): 101.2 Kcal/kg\nGlucose Infusion Rate (PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium: Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride: Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr ethacin Patient Case: Day 9 to 10 TPN Ex-25w0d, birthweight 0.87 kg, RDS, PDA Parenteral nutrition therapy day # 9\nDosing weight: 0.87 kgs.

ILE provides 20% - 30% of total energy as ILE: 2400 kcal/d × 0.2 to 0.3 = 480 - 720 kcal/d. Because the PN admixture volume is restricted to 1.5 L/d, provide 30% of energy or 720 kcal/d with ILE 30%, which is more energy dense (3 kcal/mL) than dextrose 70% (2.38 kcal/mL). ILE 30% provides 3 kcal/mL; therefore, 720 kcal/d ÷ 3 kcal/mL = 240 mL. Dextrose: energy needed from dextrose = 2400 kcal - 480 kcal from amino acids - 720 kcal from ILE = 1200 kcal/d. 1200 kcal ÷ 3.4 kcal/g = 353 g dextrose.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\npreterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus. Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4). preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus. Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n ### Calcium and phosphorus The provision of adequate calcium and phosphorus in an optimal ratio is important for bone mineralization in neonates and infants, particularly those born preterm since maximum calcium and phosphorus accretion rates occur over the last 6 weeks of gestation. While solubility limits within PN solutions prohibit the supply of minerals provided in utero during the last trimester (6–7.5 mEq/kg/d calcium and 2.3–2.7 mmol/kg/d phosphorus), providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of 1.7 mg calcium to 1 mg phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary TABLE 33-4.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Amylose is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple glucose units.\n2. The correct answer is C. The breakdown of sugars, especially lactose, lipids, and proteins is required to nourish the infant. Amylases would be used to break down complex starches; human milk does have HMOs and complex carbohydrates, but these are not digested by humans and are not necessary for infant nutrition.\n3. The correct answer is B. It is hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose.\n4. The correct answer is B. Lactase activity at the start of the third trimester is &lt;25% of that at term.\n5. The correct answer is D. Low amylase activity could result in the malabsorption of the rice cereal, which is a starch, with a resultant increase in osmotic drag from the poorly absorbed carbohydrate and the passage of the malabsorbed carbohydrate into the colon where it is fermented to SCFAs.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 57 -->\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ntrimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> process, also known as primary lactase deficiency or primary hypolactasia, commonly begins between 3 and 5 years of age and continues into adulthood.18 The prevalence of hypolactasia varies across ethnic populations as follows: 90% Asian, 80% Black, 53% Hispanic, and 15% to 25% non-Hispanic White.18 The role of variable digestive capacity for lactose in the development of illness among neonates is of uncertain significance.

Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency is a relatively rare (1/5000) autosomal recessive disorder in which patients lack sucrase and have variable isomaltase activity.15 ## Lactose Lactase is the enzyme responsible for digesting lactose, which is the primary carbohydrate in human milk and most infant formulas. Lactase hydrolyzes the disaccharide lactose into monosaccharides glucose and galactose (see Figure 3-2).3,5 Like maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, lactase is located along the brush border of the enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. Because the optimum pH for lactase activity is 6.0, its activity is highest in the jejunum and decreases toward the ileum.12 This gradient is established by 11 weeks of gestation.10 During gestation, lactase activity increases until birth, with the greatest increase occurring during the third trimester. At the beginning of the third trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 -->\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: According to established clinical texts on","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"8f48924cab2662b6c3a10025d829abe87268f0f05395d1d6485efb6deabc248d","retrieval_snapshot_id":"60c4e4c4c5a94efcb45e3c532a3e0ae9","latency_ms":2477.297306060791,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7284094766546887,"rag_context_chars":5864,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Amylose is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple glucose units.\n2. The correct answer is C. The breakdown of sugars, especially lactose, lipids, and proteins is required to nourish the infant. Amylases would be used to break down complex starches; human milk does have HMOs and complex carbohydrates, but these are not digested by humans and are not necessary for infant nutrition.\n3. The correct answer is B. It is hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose.\n4. The correct answer is B. Lactase activity at the start of the third trimester is &lt;25% of that at term.\n5. The correct answer is D. Low amylase activity could result in the malabsorption of the rice cereal, which is a starch, with a resultant increase in osmotic drag from the poorly absorbed carbohydrate and the passage of the malabsorbed carbohydrate into the colon where it is fermented to SCFAs.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 57 -->\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ntrimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> process, also known as primary lactase deficiency or primary hypolactasia, commonly begins between 3 and 5 years of age and continues into adulthood.18 The prevalence of hypolactasia varies across ethnic populations as follows: 90% Asian, 80% Black, 53% Hispanic, and 15% to 25% non-Hispanic White.18 The role of variable digestive capacity for lactose in the development of illness among neonates is of uncertain significance. Studies conducted in preterm pigs suggest that incomplete digestion of carbohydrates may be linked to the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis.19 Additionally, the time until full feeding tolerance is inversely related to lactase activity (see Figure 3-3).16,20\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nhigh throughout life. Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency is a relatively rare (1/5000) autosomal recessive disorder in which patients lack sucrase and have variable isomaltase activity.15 ## Lactose Lactase is the enzyme responsible for digesting lactose, which is the primary carbohydrate in human milk and most infant formulas. Lactase hydrolyzes the disaccharide lactose into monosaccharides glucose and galactose (see Figure 3-2).3,5 Like maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, lactase is located along the brush border of the enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. Because the optimum pH for lactase activity is 6.0, its activity is highest in the jejunum and decreases toward the ileum.12 This gradient is established by 11 weeks of gestation.10 During gestation, lactase activity increases until birth, with the greatest increase occurring during the third trimester.

In the United States, Intralipid is the primary commercial product used to provide lipids to neonates. This is a soybean-based oil with a high amount of omega-6 fatty acids (eg, linoleic acid) and phytosterols; this latter component is associated with cholestasis.¹ Other potential lipid emulsions being explored for commercial use contain fish oil, which has a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids (eg, docosahexaenoic acid) that may minimize the risk of liver disease.² A prolonged period of lipid infusion (&gt;2 weeks) can increase the risk of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.³ If a neonate who is receiving a lipid solution develops cholestasis, the lipid solution should be decreased, while protein and/or glucose supplementation should be increased to avoid caloric deprivation.⁴\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nless than 1250 g.

Manganese\nManganese is a trace element provided in neonatal parenteral nutrition. This compound activates specific enzymes (eg, superoxide dismutase), plays a role in bone structure, and assists with carbohydrate metabolism. A neonate who is deficient in manganese can develop dermatitis, hair depigmentation, growth failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive amounts can lead to basal ganglia injury as a result of manganese deposition.¹ Other trace elements have also been associated with toxicities,¹,² including the following:\n- Chromium (chronic renal failure)\n- Copper (cirrhosis of the liver)\n- Molybdenum (disruption of copper metabolism)\n- Zinc (decreased leukocyte and phagocyte activity) Excessive selenium has not been associated with toxicity.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nSridhar S, Arguello S, Lee HC.

Cysteine\nCysteine is required for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, helps to maintain redox potential, and assists with calcium homeostasis. In newborns, cysteine is a semiessential amino acid because of impaired cysteine production.¹ As a result, cysteine is routinely added to amino acid preparations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of its poor solubility, cysteine is often added last to the amino acid solution. References\n1.  Van Goudoever JB, Sulkers EJ, Timmerman M, et al.

The ASPEN Novel Nutrient Task Force recommends routine carnitine supplementation of 2 to 5 mg/kg/d to neonatal PN if no enteral source was provided.47 ### Cysteine Cysteine has been considered a conditionally essential amino acid in neonates and infants because of the enzymatic immaturity of the transsulfuration pathway responsible for the conversion of methionine to cysteine and ultimately to taurine.73 Cysteine is not a component of crystalline amino acid solutions because it is unstable and will form an insoluble precipitate.21 Common dosing for L-cysteine hydrochloride is 30 to 40 mg/g of pediatric amino acids; however, 20 mg/g may be adequate.74 In general, current practice suggests supplementation with L-cysteine hydrochloride for the first year of life, although actual practice varies widely.20 Riedijk et al75 have suggested that cysteine requirements are satisfied in 1-month-old preterm infants born at 32 weeks of gestation or older who are on a full enteral diet\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n<!-- Page 84 --> Herrera and Helms of parenteral and enteral nutrition in adult and pediatric patients.

Cysteine\nCysteine is required for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, helps to maintain redox potential, and assists with calcium homeostasis. In newborns, cysteine is a semiessential amino acid because of impaired cysteine production.¹ As a result, cysteine is routinely added to amino acid preparations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of its poor solubility, cysteine is often added last to the amino acid solution. References\n1.  Van Goudoever JB, Sulkers EJ, Timmerman M, et al.

However, apart from its critical role in the maintenance of bone and mineral metabolism, its cause-and-effect relationship with other clinical disorders remains to be defined.10--12 ### Sources Endogenous synthesis of vitamin D3 requires exposure to sunlight or irradiation in the ultraviolet B range. It is extremely efficient, and a 10-minute to 15-minute whole-body exposure to peak summer sun will generate and release up to 500 mcg (20,000 IU) of vitamin D3 into the circulation.58,59 Cutaneous production of vitamin D3 is substantially diminished by decreased exposure to sunlight from seasonal changes or time of day, clouds, aerosols, thick ozone, higher latitude, aging, clothing, sunscreen use, and melanin pigmentation.59 In dark-skinned individuals, endogenous synthesis of vitamin D is possible, although the rate of production is lower than in less-pigmented individuals. Concerns regarding the hazards of ultraviolet radiation exposure have led to revised recommendations for sunlight exposure.60 Consequently, ensuring adequate vitamin D status, especially in the presence of factors that affect its endogenous synthesis, requires attention to dietary vitamin D supplementation.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: 25-hydroxyvitamin D [","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"80a7e272b93fff1239b39c0ae52ace31b305600e8bbc7c3c67a92096f961a6e4","retrieval_snapshot_id":"02ec77582542497f9e61ce78adbafda1","latency_ms":2293.055772781372,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7253920406759842,"rag_context_chars":5582,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Polyglutamates are the forms retained in various tissues or found in blood or bile and are the forms needed for function as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfer reactions. Folate catabolism involves the cleavage of intracellular and circulatory polyglutamates to the monoglutamate form. Approximately two-thirds of the folate in plasma is protein-bound, and albumin accounts for approximately 50% of the bound folate. Folates filter freely through the glomeruli and are secreted and reabsorbed by the renal tubules. The bulk of the urine excretory products are folate cleavage products, mainly in the monoglutamate form. Extensive enterohepatic circulation of folate occurs.84 The estimated total body folate content is between 12 and 28 mg, of which approximately 50% is in the liver.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nto all enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meal, pasta products, rice, and other cereal grain products sold in the United States.

Skin immaturity, radiant warmers, and phototherapy often increase insensible losses by as much as 20–40 mL/kg. Insensible losses are high during the first few weeks of life. Up to 200 mL/kg/d of fluid may be needed to maintain normal fluid balance in the preterm neonate. Table 6-2 summarizes fluid requirements for neonates based on birth weight.1,2 The decrease in insensible losses is due mainly to the thickening of the skin, which reduces fluid losses.\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part4.md]\nthereby facilitate clearance of liquid from the airspaces and resolution of pulmonary edema.

Because preterm infants' suck-swallow-breathe coordination does not mature until 32 to 34 weeks of gestational age, they are dependent on tube feedings for up to 12 weeks.73 During this time of tube-feeding dependence, mothers must express their milk every 3 to 4 hours daily to provide adequate volume to feed their infant.61 Maintaining lactation during the often lengthy NICU stay is challenging for many mothers. Mother-infant separation, maternal illness that necessitated preterm delivery, family dynamics, lack of access to appropriate lactation counseling and support, socioeconomic status, transportation, and other factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nfactors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 Preterm MOM is preferred over other milk sources because of its unique nutrient density and bioactivity . It is imperative that mothers receive timely, appropriate, and continued lactation support and education throughout the NICU stay .

Because there are several biologically plausible mechanisms for human milk's role in the prevention of NEC, such as antigen-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins, as well as multiple observational studies demonstrating a protective effect compared with the effects of infant formula, mother's own milk is the preferred feeding choice for this neonate. B. Donor milk and mother's own milk have the same composition of bioactive factors and have equivalent protective effect on NEC; therefore, this mother should not be encouraged to pump during the hospitalization if donor milk is available.

DHA and ARA are the most abundant LCPUFAs in the brain; DHA is also found in retinal cells.41--43 DHA and ARA can be obtained from dietary sources or by the endogenous conversion of their precursors, α-linolenic acid (18:3 ω3) and linoleic acid (18:2 ω6).42,43 DHA and ARA occur naturally in human milk, with levels varying based on maternal diet.\n\nDuring pregnancy, DHA and ARA are transported across the placenta to the fetus. Fetuses can synthesize DHA and ARA after 26 weeks of gestation, though the amount produced is highly variable.43 After birth, DHA and ARA are provided via human milk or infant formula supplemented with DHA and/or ARA. Infants fed formula without supplementation have been shown to have lower levels of DHA in the brain.43\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: LCPUFAs, specifically DHA and ARA","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"bb5e4af09b408cceb3c0256d5de9db80af813bae458417d5928ebd74aa643901","retrieval_snapshot_id":"0cd7f1ed4e704500a3cb3846f2b044e9","latency_ms":2314.9502277374268,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7308508089311441,"rag_context_chars":5580,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

DHA and ARA are the most abundant LCPUFAs in the brain; DHA is also found in retinal cells.41--43 DHA and ARA can be obtained from dietary sources or by the endogenous conversion of their precursors, α-linolenic acid (18:3 ω3) and linoleic acid (18:2 ω6).42,43 DHA and ARA occur naturally in human milk, with levels varying based on maternal diet.\n\nDuring pregnancy, DHA and ARA are transported across the placenta to the fetus. Fetuses can synthesize DHA and ARA after 26 weeks of gestation, though the amount produced is highly variable.43 After birth, DHA and ARA are provided via human milk or infant formula supplemented with DHA and/or ARA. Infants fed formula without supplementation have been shown to have lower levels of DHA in the brain.43\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), such","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"bb5e4af09b408cceb3c0256d5de9db80af813bae458417d5928ebd74aa643901","retrieval_snapshot_id":"0cd7f1ed4e704500a3cb3846f2b044e9","latency_ms":3040.3051376342773,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7308508089311441,"rag_context_chars":5580,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Lysozyme is an acid-stable enzyme that has 300 times the concentration in human milk compared with cow's milk. Lysozyme is protective against gram-positive bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae.45 In addition to lactoferrin, sIgA, and lysozymes, many other bioactives in human milk act as anti-inflammatory agents and impart immunological benefits. These immune health benefits are especially important for immunocompromised, hospitalized infants.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nosteopenia status.

Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease. Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease because of the rapid response of the calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands. Preterm neonates with a chronic depletion of calcium, which can occur via medications such as glucocorticoids, diuretics, and methylxanthines, may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. These patients also have hypophosphatemia but a low tubular reabsorption of phosphate. Serum calcium is not a sensitive marker in screening for metabolic bone disease of prematurity. 43. A.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\ncontraceptives, levothyroxine, insulin, prenatal vitamins) At the expense of the milk bank, donors also need to undergo serologic screening for HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis. ## 13.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations.

Neonates who receive prolonged courses of parenteral nutrition are at risk for developing liver injury and cholestasis.¹ Enteral feedings stimulate bile flow, gallbladder contraction, and intestinal motility. Even trophic feedings can be beneficial in reducing the degree of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. If parenteral nutrition is continued in the presence of cholestasis, manganese and copper should be reduced and plasma levels monitored because these metals can accumulate to toxic levels in the cholestatic liver.

C. Having a donor human milk feeding practice in the neonatal intensive care unit has been associated with increased rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge. Studies have found that a donor human milk feeding practice for preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit does not decrease mother's own milk¹ and leads to higher rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge.² However, there are challenges with using donor milk. For example, neonate growth can be poor because the donated milk typically is obtained from women who are lactating beyond 6 months when the nutrient concentration is lower.³ The amount of protein and zinc are lower in donor human milk than in mother's own milk.⁴\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"4b9f8558fc3324071bd2648dc04a4e546888232dfe96c1f2cd13e877e12c6ffd","retrieval_snapshot_id":"c6c5643deb734eb18667f5530951c266","latency_ms":2475.991725921631,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7297434770963415,"rag_context_chars":4477,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

C. Having a donor human milk feeding practice in the neonatal intensive care unit has been associated with increased rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge. Studies have found that a donor human milk feeding practice for preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit does not decrease mother's own milk¹ and leads to higher rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge.² However, there are challenges with using donor milk. For example, neonate growth can be poor because the donated milk typically is obtained from women who are lactating beyond 6 months when the nutrient concentration is lower.³ The amount of protein and zinc are lower in donor human milk than in mother's own milk.⁴\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"4b9f8558fc3324071bd2648dc04a4e546888232dfe96c1f2cd13e877e12c6ffd","retrieval_snapshot_id":"c6c5643deb734eb18667f5530951c266","latency_ms":2472.9549884796143,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7297434770963415,"rag_context_chars":4477,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? approach the mother to discuss feeding type, and she indicates that she plans to provide infant formula only. Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? approach the mother to discuss feeding type, and she indicates that she plans to provide infant formula only. Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? A. Because there are several biologically plausible mechanisms for human milk's role in the prevention of NEC, such as antigen-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins, as well as multiple observational studies demonstrating a protective effect compared with the effects of infant formula, mother's own milk is the preferred feeding choice for this neonate. B. Donor milk and mother's own milk have the same composition of bioactive factors and have equivalent protective effect on NEC; therefore, this mother should not be encouraged to pump during the hospitalization if donor milk is available. C. Human milk may have an even more protective effect if pasteurized to eliminate potential pathogenic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Holder pasteurization (62.5°C for","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"2f44dc1692ae0702585993994d44512a6beee33a77f16f02be2ee2bed41fd6c3","retrieval_snapshot_id":"91ebc3e3d3584196a6fafe9538ee4385","latency_ms":3378.166913986206,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7285172732283358,"rag_context_chars":5164,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown. However, this increase is transient, and treated neonates have similar calcium levels 24 hours after treatment compared with levels in untreated control neonates. Treatment can also blunt the increase in parathyroid hormone concentration that occurs on the first day after birth. The use of total parenteral nutrition with a higher calcium concentration during this period is impractical because calcium phosphate crystals can precipitate in the catheters.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\n24 hours after treatment than do untreated control neonates.

A 26-weeks' gestational age neonate is 1 day old and is receiving parenteral nutrition containing calcium. What is the current understanding of calcium therapy for early hypocalcemia of preterm neonates? A. Calcium phosphate crystals administered intravenously or orally have become a useful adjunct to increasing both calcium and phosphorus delivery for preterm neonates. B. Neonates treated with calcium have significantly higher calcium levels 24 hours after treatment than do untreated control neonates. C. Several clinical trials have established that neither bolus nor continuous calcium infusions has any effect on serum calcium levels.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPharmacol. 2008;21(2):381-385 31.

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Pharmacol. 2008;21(2):381-385 31. D. The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown. However, this increase is transient, and treated neonates have similar calcium levels 24 hours after treatment compared with levels in untreated control neonates. Treatment can also blunt the increase in parathyroid hormone concentration that occurs on the first day after birth. The use of total parenteral nutrition with a higher calcium concentration during this period is impractical because calcium phosphate crystals can precipitate in the catheters.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\n24 hours after treatment than do untreated control neonates.

Thus, the current diet provided to these infants appears to be deficient in DHA. Preterm infants fed increased amounts of DHA have improved visual acuity and mental development.13,14 A multicenter prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in Italy compared 580 healthy term neonates receiving 20 mg of liquid DHA to 580 healthy term infants receiving a placebo with a focus on developmental milestones.15 The infants receiving DHA were able to sit without support 1 week earlier than the placebo group, but there was no difference in crawling, standing, or walking without assistance. It is unclear how these data from healthy term neonates relate to preterm neonates. For parenterally fed infants, the challenge to provide adequate DHA and ARA is even greater with the currently available intravenous lipid emulsions approved for use in this population.16\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nrequires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 requires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 Fatty acids and eicosanoids can also change the abundance of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression. Regulation of gene expression by nutrients is critically important in preterm neonates.

In preterm infants, initiating PN support early (within 24 hours of delivery), and providing protein in particular, has been shown to improve nitrogen balance, energy intake, and glucose tolerance without adverse metabolic effects.³⁸\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Nonnutritive sucking (NNS) involves faster","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"fcbce046eb2eae790ada5243750677e05339d190e8302b1c033b713fd15f579a","retrieval_snapshot_id":"ee96c68935484b249b6e13b7e71a1a03","latency_ms":2889.7545337677,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7308226335340815,"rag_context_chars":4993,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Concentrations of lactoferrin decrease over time and settle at 180 mg/dL by 5 months of lactation.38 Lactoferrin is necessary for iron absorption from human milk and is affected by maternal protein-energy malnutrition.40 Mothers who are protein-energy malnourished but not iron-deficient are lactoferrin-deficient.15\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nCR.

Commercially available human milk fortifiers are limited to delivering similar levels of protein and carbohydrates as human milk but are unable to contain any phosphorus because of the risk of bacterial contamination.\nB. Milk derived from mothers who have given birth preterm typically has 3 times the phosphorus content of term human milk.\nC. Phosphorus absorption from human milk is less than 20% for preterm newborns.\nD. Soy milk proteins bind and release phosphorus preferentially in acidic environments, so soy-based formulas may be a useful therapy for newborns with low phosphorus levels.\nE.

Manganese\nManganese is a trace element provided in neonatal parenteral nutrition. This compound activates specific enzymes (eg, superoxide dismutase), plays a role in bone structure, and assists with carbohydrate metabolism. A neonate who is deficient in manganese can develop dermatitis, hair depigmentation, growth failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive amounts can lead to basal ganglia injury as a result of manganese deposition.¹ Other trace elements have also been associated with toxicities,¹,² including the following:\n- Chromium (chronic renal failure)\n- Copper (cirrhosis of the liver)\n- Molybdenum (disruption of copper metabolism)\n- Zinc (decreased leukocyte and phagocyte activity) Excessive selenium has not been associated with toxicity.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\n0.01 mg ergocalciferol = 400 USP units.\nc 7 mg vitamin E = 7 USP units.

Parenteral Nutrition Handbook --- <!-- Page 89 --> CHAPTER 4\nParenteral Nutrition Formulations and Managing Component Shortages # Trace Elements Commonly used trace elements in PN formulations include zinc, copper, chromium, manganese, and selenium. These are commercially available as single-entity products and in various multiple trace element combinations and concentrations for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients. It should be noted that the commercially available multiple trace element combinations in the United States contain 3–5 times the recommended dosages for manganese and may contribute to complications in long-term patients. See Table 4-6 for trace element supplementation for PN.²⁹⁻³¹ Other trace elements that may be supplemented in PN include molybdenum, iodine, and iron.²⁹ Three injectable iron products are available, all as single-entity products. Only iron dextran is approved for addition to PN admixtures, but this should only be considered for dextrose/amino acid (2-in-1) formulations because ILEs are disrupted by iron.³⁰ Table 4-6.

Trace elements commonly added to PN solutions include zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and chromium . For term infants requiring short (ie, &lt;2 weeks) courses of PN, it may not be necessary to provide them, but they should be provided to preterm neonates upon PN initiation . In particular, zinc and copper are necessary for growth, and serious complications have been reported when they have not been provided . Table 7-17 provides the typical doses of the most commonly supplemented trace elements . Because of biliary excretion of copper and manganese, these trace elements should be reduced in patients with cholestasis . Similarly, parenteral intake of selenium and chromium should be reduced or held in cases of renal dysfunction\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: According to the clinical evidence, the most common clinical manifestation of","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"cff8309249c89bc524fed5a6a2874817c44092cba5d2d30866593a51a76f554b","retrieval_snapshot_id":"e8a95895ad9f403dadbde0d5bdf634d6","latency_ms":3420.689105987549,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7293174843122439,"rag_context_chars":5265,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Fat**: Intravenous lipid emulsions are essential components of TPN. They provide essential fatty acids and are a concentrated energy source critical for growth and development of infants not receiving enteral feedings. There are potential safety concerns regarding administration of lipid emulsions to very low birth weight infants and infants with hyperbilirubinemia, pulmonary hypertension and serious pulmonary disease.

Some Ca compounds, such as calcium citrate, are better absorbed than calcium carbonate in individuals with decreased gastric acid. About 90% of the Ca absorbed is through the small intestine, and the large intestine can absorb the remainder.[23] Dietary Ca absorption, particularly in young children, is primarily regulated by Ca rather than vitamin D intake.[1,2,24-26] At high dietary Ca intake, paracellular absorption takes place throughout the small intestine and depends on the concentration gradient.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

Brain\n\nThe highest amount of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in humans is found in the brain and retina. In the brain cortex, the greatest concentration occurs in the synapses,¹ and in the retina, the highest amount is concentrated in the photoreceptor cells. Preterm neonates have lower amounts of LCPUFAs in the brain and retina because intrauterine acquisition is decreased.²\n\n### References\n\n1. Cotman C, Blank ML, Moehl A, Synder F.

In human studies, casein-predominant formulas result in lower zinc bioavailability than whey-predominant formulas, presumably because of less casein digestion.22 Other types of human whey proteins include secretory IgA and lactoferrin.21 Secretory IgA attaches to the lining of the GI tract and prevents potential pathogenic microorganisms from adhering.9 Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that limits the ability of bacteria to thrive in the intestines. Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nUnited Kingdom: Cambridge University Press; 2006:281-283\n2.

Preterm neonates with a birth weight less than 1,500 g should receive 200 to 400 IU/d, and neonates with a birth weight less than 1,000 g should receive 400 IU/d; higher doses of 2,000 IU/d do not affect the incidence of osteopenia in this population.¹ Most preterm neonates have not \"caught up\" in terms of bone mineralization by the time of discharge home.\n\n---\n[Source: Children_s_Health_Pediatric_Nutrition_Handbook_2023.md]\nfundoplication)\n- Each treatment option has risks for preterm infants that should be carefully weighed with the benefits among the multi-disciplinary team; in most cases, symptoms improve with age ## Prematurity-Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome\n\n- May require increased calories initially due to distress with withdrawal symptoms\n- Monitor closely for infants exposed to drugs in utero or weaning from medications used inpatient\n- Excessive sucking and hyperphagia are common coping mechanisms in these infants; may need to limit oral volumes if excessive intake is thought to contribute to worsened emesis or discomfort\n- Maternal breast milk is preferred for mothers who are in treatment, but is not recommended for mothers who are using illicit drugs or alcohol; HIV-positive mothers can provide EBM if their viral load is low\n- Consider partially hydrolyzed or lactose free formula if emesis and/or diarrhea\n\n254\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 258 -->\n\nPediatric Nutrition Handbook\n255\n\n# Prematurity-Osteopenia\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Osteopenia of prematurity is highly prevalent in very low","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"b35efd77245ed1b7a50cf7a4d248a334ab0cb5c7c85825780760360017416195","retrieval_snapshot_id":"6f059f0b26914529a4ca73129acc2497","latency_ms":3036.1435413360596,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.730076005870655,"rag_context_chars":5801,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Lactoferrin concentrations are","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"391a9a2af6803bbb6c3e25861b38986f5e1ee1330543524e35ea57d246976289","retrieval_snapshot_id":"e85ee2feb95341ee917f0619df7886b8","latency_ms":2570.269823074341,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7260845683672171,"rag_context_chars":5258,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Concentrations of lactoferrin decrease over time and settle at 180 mg/dL by 5 months of lactation.38 Lactoferrin is necessary for iron absorption from human milk and is affected by maternal protein-energy malnutrition.40 Mothers who are protein-energy malnourished but not iron-deficient are lactoferrin-deficient.15\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nof amino acids into circulation.

In human studies, casein-predominant formulas result in lower zinc bioavailability than whey-predominant formulas, presumably because of less casein digestion.22 Other types of human whey proteins include secretory IgA and lactoferrin.21 Secretory IgA attaches to the lining of the GI tract and prevents potential pathogenic microorganisms from adhering.9 Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that limits the ability of bacteria to thrive in the intestines. Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"180 mg/dL).\n    *   E.","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"391a9a2af6803bbb6c3e25861b38986f5e1ee1330543524e35ea57d246976289","retrieval_snapshot_id":"e85ee2feb95341ee917f0619df7886b8","latency_ms":3276.4246463775635,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7260845683672171,"rag_context_chars":5258,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Thus, the current diet provided to these infants appears to be deficient in DHA. Preterm infants fed increased amounts of DHA have improved visual acuity and mental development.13,14 A multicenter prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in Italy compared 580 healthy term neonates receiving 20 mg of liquid DHA to 580 healthy term infants receiving a placebo with a focus on developmental milestones.15 The infants receiving DHA were able to sit without support 1 week earlier than the placebo group, but there was no difference in crawling, standing, or walking without assistance. It is unclear how these data from healthy term neonates relate to preterm neonates. For parenterally fed infants, the challenge to provide adequate DHA and ARA is even greater with the currently available intravenous lipid emulsions approved for use in this population.16\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nor bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm neonates.²⁻⁶ Fewer studies have examined the effect on intraventricular hemorrhage, but none have found a difference with LCPUFA-enriched formulas.³⁻⁵ ## References 1.

Therefore, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are required in the human diet and are termed \"essential fatty acids.\"1 The shortest chain ω-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid (LA). Humans can convert LA to arachidonic acid (ARA). The shortest chain ω-3 fatty acid is α-linolenic acid (αLA). Humans can convert αLA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and convert EPA very slowly to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The same enzyme pool is used to metabolize LA and αLA to their respective longer-chain metabolites. The more prevalent fatty acid is preferentially metabolized. Thus, with a diet high in the ω-6 fatty acid LA, LA will be preferentially metabolized over the ω-3 fatty acid αLA. ARA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-6) and EPA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-3) are released from membranes and further metabolized to a cascade of eicosanoids. Although it is not quite so simple, eicosanoids from ω-6 fatty acids are generally considered proinflammatory and those from ω-3 fatty acids are considered weakly anti-inflammatory. The docosanoid products of DHA also have anti-inflammatory actions.3\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nrequires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 requires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 Fatty acids and eicosanoids can also change the abundance of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression.

Peripheral vascular access may be used to infuse PN, but the final osmolarity must be less than 900 mOsm/L to decrease the risk of phlebitis.27 This limits the amount of protein, dextrose, and electrolytes that can be delivered. Patients receiving PN via the peripheral route must be able to tolerate higher volumes of fluid to meet their nutrition goals because a more dilute PN must be used.

Using products that contain these preformed EFAs may be beneficial in this population, but evidence is still lacking. Serum triglyceride (TG) levels should be monitored for ILE tolerance. The goal is to have serum TG levels less than 250 mg/dL. Infants prone to hypertriglyceridemia should have their lipids infused over 24 hours at an ILE infusion rate not to exceed 0.15–0.17 g/kg/h (depending on ILE product).³¹ Because of low amounts of lipoprotein lipase in their capillary epithelium that facilitates TG metabolism, infants may benefit from the addition of heparin to the PN at 0.5–1 U/mL of PN to induce the enzyme and improve clearance.³² The addition of the lysine derivative levocarnitine has also been shown to help manage hypertriglyceridemia by transporting long-chain TGs across the cell membrane into the mitochondria.³³\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby reducing VLDL levels. However, elevated TG levels have been reported in all sources of ILE. Other oil sources include the combination of soybean, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), olive, and fish. ## Carnitine and Heparin\n\nCarnitine is responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation to produce energy. Therefore, carnitine can aid in reducing TG levels. However, carnitine is not present in PN solutions and may need to be added if deficiency is present, indicated by free carnitine blood levels &lt;8.0 mmol/L. Neonates born prior to 32 to 34 weeks of gestation have been found to be carnitine-deficient because carnitine accretion happens in the last trimester of gestation.⁴⁰ Supplementation as high as 5 to 10 mg/kg/d has been used in patients with elevated TG levels and those on PN longer than 7 days. If carnitine deficiency is present, then up to 50 mg/kg/d may be needed.⁴¹\n\nHeparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase activity by degrading TGs into fatty acid and glycerol. This activity is depressed in preterm infants. Infants receiving 1 U/mL heparin had lower TG levels than those receiving 0.5 U/mL or no heparin in the PN solution.⁴⁴\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nand DHA may be required depending on the overall health of the patient.

Lipoprotein lipase in the capillary endothelium releases free fatty acids, which are delivered to tissues by chylomicrons . The fatty acids are carried in the blood bound to albumin and are delivered to the tissues to use for fuel . When fatty acids are used for fuel, they are activated to the fatty acyl-CoA at the outer mitochondrial membrane . Fatty acyl-CoA is the correct high-energy state for β-oxidation, but the enzymes for β-oxidation are located within the mitochondrial matrix (see Figure 4-3), and the fatty acyl-CoA cannot cross the inner membrane of the mitochondria to reach these enzymes\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"c1b9632b53d535c5dfa95cdf41d44eb95874146a232af3d190d3078675cc07a5","retrieval_snapshot_id":"9042a508c4b949b193022b39bed1cd42","latency_ms":2400.925397872925,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7297708538625878,"rag_context_chars":5180,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

The goal is to have serum TG levels less than 250 mg/dL. Infants prone to hypertriglyceridemia should have their lipids infused over 24 hours at an ILE infusion rate not to exceed 0.15–0.17 g/kg/h (depending on ILE product).³¹ Because of low amounts of lipoprotein lipase in their capillary epithelium that facilitates TG metabolism, infants may benefit from the addition of heparin to the PN at 0.5–1 U/mL of PN to induce the enzyme and improve clearance.³² The addition of the lysine derivative levocarnitine has also been shown to help manage hypertriglyceridemia by transporting long-chain TGs across the cell membrane into the mitochondria.³³\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby reducing VLDL levels. However, elevated TG levels have been reported in all sources of ILE. Other oil sources include the combination of soybean, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), olive, and fish. ## Carnitine and Heparin\n\nCarnitine is responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation to produce energy. Therefore, carnitine can aid in reducing TG levels. However, carnitine is not present in PN solutions and may need to be added if deficiency is present, indicated by free carnitine blood levels &lt;8.0 mmol/L. Neonates born prior to 32 to 34 weeks of gestation have been found to be carnitine-deficient because carnitine accretion happens in the last trimester of gestation.⁴⁰ Supplementation as high as 5 to 10 mg/kg/d has been used in patients with elevated TG levels and those on PN longer than 7 days. If carnitine deficiency is present, then up to 50 mg/kg/d may be needed.⁴¹\n\nHeparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase activity by degrading TGs into fatty acid and glycerol.

Parenteral nutrition in neonates should contain the following trace elements: zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, selenium, and molybdenum.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc.

Preterm neonates with a birth weight less than 1,500 g should receive 200 to 400 IU/d, and neonates with a birth weight less than 1,000 g should receive 400 IU/d; higher doses of 2,000 IU/d do not affect the incidence of osteopenia in this population.¹ Most preterm neonates have not \"caught up\" in terms of bone mineralization by the time of discharge home.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nneonates born younger than 25-weeks' gestational age.¹,² It is associated with rates of mortality of 20% and neurodevelopmental impairment of 57% in neonates with a birth weight less than 1,000 g.² neonates born younger than 25-weeks' gestational age.¹,² It is associated with rates of mortality of 20% and neurodevelopmental impairment of 57% in neonates with a birth weight less than 1,000 g.² References\n1.

Significantly improved folate status, indicated by population survey of red cell and serum folate, has been reported since the mandate for folic acid fortification of selected foods. ### Supplementation\n\nTaking folate supplements in the preconception period and during pregnancy (for the prevention of neural tube defects) is an established practice.40 Excessive folate intake may precipitate or exacerbate neuropathy in individuals with vitamin B_{12} deficiency. Folate supplementation has been implicated in delayed diagnosis of pernicious anemia until after irreversible neurological damage has occurred.83,86 These risks are increased in cases of reduced hepatic transformation of folic acid (eg, caused by genetic variants or during some pharmacotherapies). 5-MTHF may be a better alternative to folic acid supplementation because it is immediately available as a methyl donor in many metabolic reactions. Additionally, it does not accumulate in blood\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 120 -->\n\nlike folic acid does in cases of reduced hepatic transformation. However, the use of 5-MTHF instead of folate supplement under various clinical conditions remains to be determined.86\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The US Public Health Service and","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"b160c0880eba1ce9471fd09a711c1d66cbbc3fbfbf6ac3bb911b931e21d49c80","retrieval_snapshot_id":"bb716a75becd4d0e9ea6f99ecb97334a","latency_ms":2297.3642349243164,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.6617688536884339,"rag_context_chars":5616,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandated the addition of folic acid to all enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meal, pasta products, rice, and other cereal grain products sold in the United States.

Significantly improved folate status, indicated by population survey of red cell and serum folate, has been reported since the mandate for folic acid fortification of selected foods. ### Supplementation\n\nTaking folate supplements in the preconception period and during pregnancy (for the prevention of neural tube defects) is an established practice.40 Excessive folate intake may precipitate or exacerbate neuropathy in individuals with vitamin B_{12} deficiency. Folate supplementation has been implicated in delayed diagnosis of pernicious anemia until after irreversible neurological damage has occurred.83,86 These risks are increased in cases of reduced hepatic transformation of folic acid (eg, caused by genetic variants or during some pharmacotherapies). 5-MTHF may be a better alternative to folic acid supplementation because it is immediately available as a methyl donor in many metabolic reactions. Additionally, it does not accumulate in blood\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 120 -->\n\nlike folic acid does in cases of reduced hepatic transformation. However, the use of 5-MTHF instead of folate supplement under various clinical conditions remains to be determined.86\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The US Public Health Service and the CDC recommend that all women","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"b160c0880eba1ce9471fd09a711c1d66cbbc3fbfbf6ac3bb911b931e21d49c80","retrieval_snapshot_id":"bb716a75becd4d0e9ea6f99ecb97334a","latency_ms":3063.9069080352783,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.6617688536884339,"rag_context_chars":5616,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Cysteine\nCysteine is required for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, helps to maintain redox potential, and assists with calcium homeostasis. In newborns, cysteine is a semiessential amino acid because of impaired cysteine production.¹ As a result, cysteine is routinely added to amino acid preparations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of its poor solubility, cysteine is often added last to the amino acid solution. References\n1.  Van Goudoever JB, Sulkers EJ, Timmerman M, et al.

Glutathione\n\nMultiple antioxidant systems, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic, have evolved to counteract oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important nonenzymatic intracellular antioxidant. GSH molecules form a disulfide bond to form oxidized GSH (GSSG) and in the process serve as electron donors, leading to reduction of disulfide bonds. Glutathione reductase then reduces GSSG back to GSH by using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor. Other nonenzymatic antioxidants include transferrin and ceruloplasmin, which can bind transition metals, as well as free radical quenchers, such as uric acid and bilirubin.\n\nEnzymatic pathways of defense against free radical injury include the superoxide dismutase family of antioxidant enzymes, catalases, GSH peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.¹ Newborns, particularly those born preterm, are at increased risk of oxidative stress because of an immature antioxidant system.¹,²\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ncholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 Selenium is critical for antioxidant capacity, primarily through glutathione peroxidase, for immune function, and as a cofactor for thyroid hormone production and regulation; needs may be increased with critical illness and thermal injury.55,63 Selenium deficiency may present as cardiomyopathy (ie, Keshan disease), myalgias, myositis, hemolysis, and impaired cellular immunity.55,63\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Selenium is an essential trace element and a critical cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which neutralizes hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides.

Glutathione\n\nMultiple antioxidant systems, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic, have evolved to counteract oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important nonenzymatic intracellular antioxidant. GSH molecules form a disulfide bond to form oxidized GSH (GSSG) and in the process serve as electron donors, leading to reduction of disulfide bonds. Glutathione reductase then reduces GSSG back to GSH by using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor. Other nonenzymatic antioxidants include transferrin and ceruloplasmin, which can bind transition metals, as well as free radical quenchers, such as uric acid and bilirubin.\n\nEnzymatic pathways of defense against free radical injury include the superoxide dismutase family of antioxidant enzymes, catalases, GSH peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.¹ Newborns, particularly those born preterm, are at increased risk of oxidative stress because of an immature antioxidant system.¹,²\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ncholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 Selenium is critical for antioxidant capacity, primarily through glutathione peroxidase, for immune function, and as a cofactor for thyroid hormone production and regulation; needs may be increased with critical illness and thermal injury.55,63 Selenium deficiency may present as cardiomyopathy (ie, Keshan disease), myalgias, myositis, hemolysis, and impaired cellular immunity.55,63\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Selenium is a vital trace","parsed_answer":"UNKNOWN","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"05040f409f4506edb6b93cc363d08b4b81e148988c5ade47e7738abd0453e754","retrieval_snapshot_id":"24215f395c2447e1b1eed2594a967d0c","latency_ms":2374.48787689209,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7301286716563767,"rag_context_chars":6018,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Certainly, oral feeds can be added on top of continuous feeds to allow the infant to acquire oral motor skills. The more complicated infants have greater duodenal dysmotility and may have required a tapering enteroplasty; they often have a G-tube inserted to facilitate gastric decompression, thereby protecting the anastomosis, and allowing the infant greater success in extubating from mechanical ventilation without a nasogastric tube in place.
