A neonate is born at 28 weeks' gestational age and has poor tone and respiratory effort after cesarean delivery for maternal indications, with maternal history of preeclampsia and fetal intolerance of labor. The Apgar score is 3 at 1 minute, 4 at 5 minutes, and 6 at 10 minutes. The newborn receives positive pressure ventilation and is intubated. The blood gas shows a metabolic and respiratory acidosis. What is the current status of evaluation and practice for preterm newborns and neonatal encephalopathy? A. Although the trials are still ongoing, due to the likelihood of benefit and low risk of harm, this patient should receive therapeutic hypothermia. B.

These guidelines assume close monitoring of body weight, intake/output measurements, and serum sodium as noted above. 6. After the brisk diuresis that usually occurs during the first 3-7 days, urine output generally decreases to about 2-4 mL/kg/h, and fluid intake can be adjusted to about 120-150 mL/kg/d. 7.

Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W. We may infuse concentrations between D3W and D12.5W through a peripheral IV. Higher concentrations require central access. F.

However, until an optimal multitrace element product is developed, one mechanism for dose-adjusting trace elements based on age-specific or disease-specific needs is to supplement PN solutions with copper, selenium, and zinc using the single-entity products instead of the multitrace element products. Thus, accumulation of chromium and manganese can be avoided. For institutions using multitrace element products, supplemental zinc may be required in certain patients, such as preterm infants and those with increased GI losses.

Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\ntherapeutic doses.\n # Insulin\n\nBecause the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended.[64]\n # Special Situations therapeutic doses.\n # Insulin\n\nBecause the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended.[64]\n # Special Situations\n # Starter PN Evidence has demonstrated that early PN administration in preterm LBW neonates can improve growth and potentially neurodevelopment. Within hours of delivery, a solution of protein (as amino acids, fat [in the form of ILE], and carbohydrates [as dextrose]) is administered until a customized PN can be compounded. Also, referred to as \"vanilla bags\" or \"day of life 1 PN,\" these solutions are started soon --- <!-- Page 232 --> after birth and are intended to prevent the catabolic processes that can result in additional muscle mass loss. These solutions provide sufficient energy and protein and sufficient calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. Typical starter PNs contain dextrose, amino acids, and calcium but are free of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Some programs also provide ILE as part of the starter PN provision.65\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part2.md]\n1/2 NS or NS) should be listed, especially with small preemies, as the NaCl delivery from a peripheral arterial line can be significant: 1/2 NS @ 1 mL/hr in a 500 gram baby gives 3.7 mEq/kg/day NaCl. 1/2 NS or NS) should be listed, especially with small preemies, as the NaCl delivery from a peripheral arterial line can be significant: 1/2 NS @ 1 mL/hr in a 500 gram baby gives 3.7 mEq/kg/day NaCl. 1/2 NS or NS) should be listed, especially with small preemies, as the NaCl delivery from a peripheral arterial line can be significant: 1/2 NS @ 1 mL/hr in a 500 gram baby gives 3.7 mEq/kg/day NaCl. E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings. Thus, for patients whose feedings are changing or at high risk for feeding intolerance, it may be better not to include the feeds in the daily PN order.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Standard PN additives in the first weeks for preterm neonates include multivitamins and trace elements (A) routinely per ASPEN guidelines to prevent deficiencies, and heparin (D) often added to starter and ongoing PN to prevent line occlusion/phlebitis (explicitly noted in context as a possible additive in starter solutions).

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively.

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is being considered as a therapy. Which is an accurate statement about this neonate? A. Early CPAP may prevent the need for subsequent mechanical ventilation by forming and maintaining a sufficient functional residual capacity and a large enough tidal volume. B. Gaseous distension of the stomach—CPAP belly—does not occur when nasal prongs are used.\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part1.md]\nthe Care of Micropreemies 37 b.

To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13).

Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth.

This caution is emphasized in a recent ASPEN position paper.14 Often, nonprotein calories of 60 to 80 kcal/kg/d, perhaps even less, are sufficient to meet initial neonate goals.15 Documented studies indicate that preterm neonates often require a generous protein supply, perhaps as high as 4 g/kg/d, which primarily provides a substrate for tissue repair but does not independently prevent catabolism of the existing muscle mass. Counting this protein delivery as energy-yielding caloric intake may result in inadequate caloric provision; this is the basis for calculating and targeting nonprotein calories in the acute perioperative setting. To provide an optimal substrate for nutrient assimilation, a nonprotein calorie-to-nitrogen ratio of 130:1 to 210:1 is generally recommended as the target PN solution.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nwhich prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria.

Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

A neonate is born at 28 weeks' gestational age and has poor tone and respiratory effort after cesarean delivery for maternal indications, with maternal history of preeclampsia and fetal intolerance of labor. The Apgar score is 3 at 1 minute, 4 at 5 minutes, and 6 at 10 minutes. The newborn receives positive pressure ventilation and is intubated. The blood gas shows a metabolic and respiratory acidosis. What is the current status of evaluation and practice for preterm newborns and neonatal encephalopathy? A. Although the trials are still ongoing, due to the likelihood of benefit and low risk of harm, this patient should receive therapeutic hypothermia. B.

A neonate is born at 28 weeks' gestational age and has poor tone and respiratory effort after cesarean delivery for maternal indications, with maternal history of preeclampsia and fetal intolerance of labor. The Apgar score is 3 at 1 minute, 4 at 5 minutes, and 6 at 10 minutes. The newborn receives positive pressure ventilation and is intubated. The blood gas shows a metabolic and respiratory acidosis. What is the current status of evaluation and practice for preterm newborns and neonatal encephalopathy? A. Although the trials are still ongoing, due to the likelihood of benefit and low risk of harm, this patient should receive therapeutic hypothermia. B. An Apgar score of 7 or less at 5 minutes is highly predictive of moderate to severe cerebral palsy at 3-year follow-up.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\npregnant woman has been clinically thyrotoxic and has been receiving pharmacologic therapy .

Although the incidence is low, several potential complications are associated with ILE use, such as infusion-related adverse reactions and allergy to the ILE components . Depending on the length of the PN therapy and the nutrition status of the patient, ILE-free PN may result in essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) . Two polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and α-linolenic acid, cannot be synthesized by the body and are considered essential . Clinical manifestations of EFAD include scaly dermatitis, alopecia, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, fatty liver, and anemia.10 Biochemical evidence of EFAD is determined by a triene-to-tetraene ratio of >0.2 and can occur within 1--3 weeks in adults receiving ILE-free PN.11 The adult requirements for linoleic acid are met through exogenous sources or endogenously through the lipolysis of adipose tissue\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nAcid (EFA) Deficiency Monitoring: EFA deficiency may develop in 1-3 weeks on no/low exogenous EFA delivery.

Best match to guidelines for normal growth (not minimal/maintenance) is C (100–130 kcal/kg/day), as A/B are suboptimal for normal rates per UCSF/ASPEN, D excessive (fat risk per Avery's).\nAnswer: C","parsed_answer":"C","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":"b288e4a52a77895306ff4028a7999f9b0bb79d032503dbe5524f0b0860351cbc","retrieval_snapshot_id":"ec082fe8574c4a60b497fb38e0dd0b7a","latency_ms":26245.17273902893,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.72701672975264,"rag_context_chars":4627,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Bone mineralization is improved in preterm infants given mineral-rich preterm and postdischarge formulas compared to standard term formulas. However, this may not persist into adulthood.205 Human milk with human milk fortifier is currently recommended for small preterm infants because it can preserve the beneficial nutrition and immunological effects of human milk while providing additional energy, protein, minerals, and other micronutrients. Preterm formula (vs term formula) is recommended for formula-fed preterm infants. However, there is no evidence indicating that postdischarge formulas improve developmental outcomes more than standard term formulas after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, in the smallest infants, postdischarge formulas have been observed to enhance head growth.

For infants with a history of osteopenia of prematurity or a prolonged course of PN, preterm infant formulas may be used to supplement mineral intake up to a weight of approximately 3.6 kg.[94] Preterm infants are transitioned to preterm discharge formulas before discharge from the hospital. These formulas are enriched with protein and minerals, are standard at 22 kcal/oz, and are available as an RTF liquid and powder. Infants will require vitamin D supplementation to meet the recommended dietary allowance until taking at least 24 oz/d.[95,96]\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: For preterm infants approaching discharge, guidelines recommend transitioning to transitional/postdischarge premature formulas (e.g., Similac Neosure, Enfamil EnfaCare at 22 kcal/oz) 1 week prior to discharge to provide enriched protein, minerals, and calories for catch-up growth.

Preterm infants, especially those with extremely low birth weight (ELBW), are at high risk of extrauterine growth restriction. Given their immature development and body composition, their nutrition requirements exceed those of term infants. In infants with ELBW, developmental achievement and reduced neurological complications are associated with higher growth rates. Preterm infants are very responsive to nutrition supplementation while in the hospital and following discharge.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Postnatal growth failure (PGF) in ELBW infants is multifactorial, with established risk factors including male gender (due to higher baseline metabolic needs and growth patterns), prolonged respiratory support at 28 days (indicative of BPD, increasing energy expenditure and often requiring steroids), and NEC (causing prolonged NPO status, catabolism, and surgical interventions).

As such, they reflect current advances in prenatal care.13,14 Newborn term and preterm infants are classified by birth weight (see Table 30-2) and gestational age (GA) . The latter is calculated using the Ballard newborn maturational exam or by referencing the prenatal ultrasound or the date of the birthing parent's last menstrual period.15 Thereafter, serial longitudinal measurement of weight, length, and head circumference is the primary method for monitoring and assessing nutrition status and adequacy of growth . Low birth weight (LBW) characterizes infants with a birth weight <2500 g, regardless of gestational age; small for gestational age (SGA) or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) refers to newborns with birth weight <10th percentile for GA . LBW and SGA may result from preterm birth, restricted intrauterine growth, genetics, or a combination of multiple factors.16,17 Infants who are SGA at birth but have proportional reductions in weight, length, and head circumference are categorized as “symmetrical,” “proportional,” or “stunted” IUGR\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\n(VLBW) neonates.¹ Data from 2007 showed that late-onset sepsis occurred in 20% of VLBW neonates in the United States, whereas early-onset sepsis affected approximately 2% of this population.² --- (VLBW) neonates.¹ Data from 2007 showed that late-onset sepsis occurred in 20% of VLBW neonates in the United States, whereas early-onset sepsis affected approximately 2% of this population.² --- (VLBW) neonates.¹ Data from 2007 showed that late-onset sepsis occurred in 20% of VLBW neonates in the United States, whereas early-onset sepsis affected approximately 2% of this population.² --- <!-- Page 487 --> Infectious Diseases # References\n\n1.

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: 9_AcidBaseDisorders.md]\nNUTRITION SUPPORT\nCERTIFICATE Upon admission to the hospital and continuation of PN, what change should be made based on RK's ABG? to multiple days of high volume emesis.\n- Laboratory values:\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nand the neonate will become catabolic and break down their protein stores for energy.

These include minimizing aluminum exposure, protecting the solutions from light, and avoidance of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate--containing materials.

Expression of human milk impacts nutrients such as fat, which can be variable based on milk expression timing; vitamin C, which is vulnerable to light exposure; and bioactive ingredients, which may be diminished during freezing.112,113 Healthcare facilities should prepare, store, and deliver human milk safely to protect and preserve the milk. Accurate track-and-trace systems must also be in place to prevent incorrect administration of human milk.113,114\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby mixing each feed with an HMF or preterm formula. Clinicians should include the family when planning prescriptions. For a parent-centered algorithm to use at discharge, see Figure 11-3. ## Term Infants Hospitalized term infants often have a diagnosis that impacts nutrient requirements, absorption, and delivery. As with preterm infants, hospitalized term infants are separated from their mothers and may undergo surgery and/or intubation, which may temporarily prevent direct breastfeeding. The provision of expressed MOM is important to protect these infants from common infections in immunocompromised infants. Human milk fortification is necessary for term infants who have fluid restrictions (<140 mL/kg/d);increased energy needs (with cardiac or pulmonary disorders); andexcess nutrient losses or poor absorption from diuretic use, ostomies (colostomy, jejunostomy, thoracostomy), dialysis, cystic fibrosis, hepatic, or renal failure.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nbe required to meet the nutritional needs of this vulnerable population.

Clinical decisions to adjust the enteral feeding regimen are determined by several factors, primarily stool or ostomy output, evidence of malabsorption, and other less objective symptoms such as abdominal fullness, irritability, and regurgitation. Currently, decisions related to advancing enteral feeding, weaning PN, and long-term monitoring of patients at risk for growth failure are based almost completely on experience, tradition, and art rather than evidence-based algorithms. However, institutions have created feeding protocols to standardize their own practice with excellent results at expediting PN-weaning and reducing IF-associated liver disease (IFALD) incidence.49 The understanding of the relative importance of these factors, how they are incorporated into daily management, and how they impact adaptation in patients with IF is critical if the management of infants with IF is to move beyond art and tradition and into an evidence-based practice of medicine.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nhas been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom.

At the very least, minimal or trophic feeds are encouraged to maintain mucosal health. Oral feeds, in small volumes, should be encouraged to maintain oral skills.\n\nHuman milk is recommended in infants because it contains immunoglobulins, prebiotics, and growth factors, which help in intestinal adaptation. Donor breast milk can be used for preterm infants under 32 weeks’ GA. If human milk is not available, formulas can be used. Amino acid-based formulas or extensively hydrolyzed formulas are\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 456 -->\n\npreferred because children with SBS absorb nutrients better if they are broken down.²\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nwhich prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria. Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? which prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria. Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

It is ordered in g/kg daily. IL-20 provides 0.2 g/mL of lipid, and 2 kcal/mL (9 kcal/g of lipid, and an additional 0.2 kcal/mL from glycerol). Thus, 0.1 mL/kg/hr delivers about 0.5 g/kg/day; 15 mL/kg/day delivers 3 g/kg/day, and 30 kcal/kg/day. Remember to wean the IL-20 as feedings advance, since fats make up most of the caloric content of milk. Once feedings of ≥ 80 mL/kg/d are achieved, the IL-20 rate should be restricted to 1 g/kg/day, and IL-20 may be stopped when feedings are ≥ 100-120 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\n: 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 : 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 Enteral feeding: 11 ml Q 3 hrs of Full strength Breast Milk/MBM\n(0.68 cal/ml) provides 67.4 Kcal/kg and 101.1 ml/kg\nTotal Kcals (all sources): 101.2 Kcal/kg\nGlucose Infusion Rate (PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium: Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride: Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr ethacin Patient Case: Day 9 to 10 TPN Ex-25w0d, birthweight 0.87 kg, RDS, PDA Parenteral nutrition therapy day # 9\nDosing weight: 0.87 kgs.

ILE 30% provides 3 kcal/mL; therefore, 720 kcal/d ÷ 3 kcal/mL = 240 mL. Dextrose: energy needed from dextrose = 2400 kcal - 480 kcal from amino acids - 720 kcal from ILE = 1200 kcal/d. 1200 kcal ÷ 3.4 kcal/g = 353 g dextrose.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\npreterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n ### Calcium and phosphorus The provision of adequate calcium and phosphorus in an optimal ratio is important for bone mineralization in neonates and infants, particularly those born preterm since maximum calcium and phosphorus accretion rates occur over the last 6 weeks of gestation. While solubility limits within PN solutions prohibit the supply of minerals provided in utero during the last trimester (6–7.5 mEq/kg/d calcium and 2.3–2.7 mmol/kg/d phosphorus), providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of 1.7 mg calcium to 1 mg phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary TABLE 33-4.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Amylose is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple glucose units.\n2. The correct answer is C. The breakdown of sugars, especially lactose, lipids, and proteins is required to nourish the infant. Amylases would be used to break down complex starches; human milk does have HMOs and complex carbohydrates, but these are not digested by humans and are not necessary for infant nutrition.\n3. The correct answer is B. It is hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose.\n4. The correct answer is B. Lactase activity at the start of the third trimester is &lt;25% of that at term.\n5. The correct answer is D. Low amylase activity could result in the malabsorption of the rice cereal, which is a starch, with a resultant increase in osmotic drag from the poorly absorbed carbohydrate and the passage of the malabsorbed carbohydrate into the colon where it is fermented to SCFAs.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 57 -->\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ntrimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> process, also known as primary lactase deficiency or primary hypolactasia, commonly begins between 3 and 5 years of age and continues into adulthood.18 The prevalence of hypolactasia varies across ethnic populations as follows: 90% Asian, 80% Black, 53% Hispanic, and 15% to 25% non-Hispanic White.18 The role of variable digestive capacity for lactose in the development of illness among neonates is of uncertain significance. Studies conducted in preterm pigs suggest that incomplete digestion of carbohydrates may be linked to the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis.19 Additionally, the time until full feeding tolerance is inversely related to lactase activity (see Figure 3-3).16,20\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nhigh throughout life. Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency is a relatively rare (1/5000) autosomal recessive disorder in which patients lack sucrase and have variable isomaltase activity.15 ## Lactose Lactase is the enzyme responsible for digesting lactose, which is the primary carbohydrate in human milk and most infant formulas. Lactase hydrolyzes the disaccharide lactose into monosaccharides glucose and galactose (see Figure 3-2).3,5 Like maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, lactase is located along the brush border of the enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. Because the optimum pH for lactase activity is 6.0, its activity is highest in the jejunum and decreases toward the ileum.12 This gradient is established by 11 weeks of gestation.10 During gestation, lactase activity increases until birth, with the greatest increase occurring during the third trimester.

Amylose is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple glucose units.\n2. The correct answer is C. The breakdown of sugars, especially lactose, lipids, and proteins is required to nourish the infant. Amylases would be used to break down complex starches; human milk does have HMOs and complex carbohydrates, but these are not digested by humans and are not necessary for infant nutrition.\n3. The correct answer is B. It is hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose.\n4. The correct answer is B. Lactase activity at the start of the third trimester is &lt;25% of that at term.\n5. The correct answer is D. Low amylase activity could result in the malabsorption of the rice cereal, which is a starch, with a resultant increase in osmotic drag from the poorly absorbed carbohydrate and the passage of the malabsorbed carbohydrate into the colon where it is fermented to SCFAs.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 57 -->\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ntrimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> process, also known as primary lactase deficiency or primary hypolactasia, commonly begins between 3 and 5 years of age and continues into adulthood.18 The prevalence of hypolactasia varies across ethnic populations as follows: 90% Asian, 80% Black, 53% Hispanic, and 15% to 25% non-Hispanic White.18 The role of variable digestive capacity for lactose in the development of illness among neonates is of uncertain significance.

Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency is a relatively rare (1/5000) autosomal recessive disorder in which patients lack sucrase and have variable isomaltase activity.15 ## Lactose Lactase is the enzyme responsible for digesting lactose, which is the primary carbohydrate in human milk and most infant formulas. Lactase hydrolyzes the disaccharide lactose into monosaccharides glucose and galactose (see Figure 3-2).3,5 Like maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, lactase is located along the brush border of the enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. Because the optimum pH for lactase activity is 6.0, its activity is highest in the jejunum and decreases toward the ileum.12 This gradient is established by 11 weeks of gestation.10 During gestation, lactase activity increases until birth, with the greatest increase occurring during the third trimester.

In the United States, Intralipid is the primary commercial product used to provide lipids to neonates. This is a soybean-based oil with a high amount of omega-6 fatty acids (eg, linoleic acid) and phytosterols; this latter component is associated with cholestasis.¹ Other potential lipid emulsions being explored for commercial use contain fish oil, which has a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids (eg, docosahexaenoic acid) that may minimize the risk of liver disease.² A prolonged period of lipid infusion (&gt;2 weeks) can increase the risk of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.³ If a neonate who is receiving a lipid solution develops cholestasis, the lipid solution should be decreased, while protein and/or glucose supplementation should be increased to avoid caloric deprivation.⁴\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nless than 1250 g.

Manganese\nManganese is a trace element provided in neonatal parenteral nutrition. This compound activates specific enzymes (eg, superoxide dismutase), plays a role in bone structure, and assists with carbohydrate metabolism. A neonate who is deficient in manganese can develop dermatitis, hair depigmentation, growth failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive amounts can lead to basal ganglia injury as a result of manganese deposition.¹ Other trace elements have also been associated with toxicities,¹,² including the following:\n- Chromium (chronic renal failure)\n- Copper (cirrhosis of the liver)\n- Molybdenum (disruption of copper metabolism)\n- Zinc (decreased leukocyte and phagocyte activity) Excessive selenium has not been associated with toxicity.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nSridhar S, Arguello S, Lee HC.

The trace element preparations for neonatal parenteral nutrition are commercially available as single or combination products. However, none of the combination products addresses the requirements at every gestational age or clinical condition, and each may inadvertently provide a specific trace element in amounts in excess of the recommended dose, leading to potential toxicity.

These are commercially available as single-entity products and in various multiple trace element combinations and concentrations for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients. It should be noted that the commercially available multiple trace element combinations in the United States contain 3–5 times the recommended dosages for manganese and may contribute to complications in long-term patients. See Table 4-6 for trace element supplementation for PN.²⁹⁻³¹ Other trace elements that may be supplemented in PN include molybdenum, iodine, and iron.²⁹ Three injectable iron products are available, all as single-entity products. Only iron dextran is approved for addition to PN admixtures, but this should only be considered for dextrose/amino acid (2-in-1) formulations because ILEs are disrupted by iron.³⁰ Table 4-6.

Cysteine\nCysteine is required for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, helps to maintain redox potential, and assists with calcium homeostasis. In newborns, cysteine is a semiessential amino acid because of impaired cysteine production.¹ As a result, cysteine is routinely added to amino acid preparations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of its poor solubility, cysteine is often added last to the amino acid solution. References\n1.  Van Goudoever JB, Sulkers EJ, Timmerman M, et al.

The ASPEN Novel Nutrient Task Force recommends routine carnitine supplementation of 2 to 5 mg/kg/d to neonatal PN if no enteral source was provided.47 ### Cysteine Cysteine has been considered a conditionally essential amino acid in neonates and infants because of the enzymatic immaturity of the transsulfuration pathway responsible for the conversion of methionine to cysteine and ultimately to taurine.73 Cysteine is not a component of crystalline amino acid solutions because it is unstable and will form an insoluble precipitate.21 Common dosing for L-cysteine hydrochloride is 30 to 40 mg/g of pediatric amino acids; however, 20 mg/g may be adequate.74 In general, current practice suggests supplementation with L-cysteine hydrochloride for the first year of life, although actual practice varies widely.20 Riedijk et al75 have suggested that cysteine requirements are satisfied in 1-month-old preterm infants born at 32 weeks of gestation or older who are on a full enteral diet\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n<!-- Page 84 --> Herrera and Helms of parenteral and enteral nutrition in adult and pediatric patients.

However, apart from its critical role in the maintenance of bone and mineral metabolism, its cause-and-effect relationship with other clinical disorders remains to be defined.10--12 ### Sources Endogenous synthesis of vitamin D3 requires exposure to sunlight or irradiation in the ultraviolet B range. It is extremely efficient, and a 10-minute to 15-minute whole-body exposure to peak summer sun will generate and release up to 500 mcg (20,000 IU) of vitamin D3 into the circulation.58,59 Cutaneous production of vitamin D3 is substantially diminished by decreased exposure to sunlight from seasonal changes or time of day, clouds, aerosols, thick ozone, higher latitude, aging, clothing, sunscreen use, and melanin pigmentation.59 In dark-skinned individuals, endogenous synthesis of vitamin D is possible, although the rate of production is lower than in less-pigmented individuals. Concerns regarding the hazards of ultraviolet radiation exposure have led to revised recommendations for sunlight exposure.60 Consequently, ensuring adequate vitamin D status, especially in the presence of factors that affect its endogenous synthesis, requires attention to dietary vitamin D supplementation.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the major circulating metabolite that reflects cumulative effects of sunlight exposure and dietary vitamin D intake, serving as the best marker of nutritional vitamin D status per ASPEN guidelines. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has a short half-life and fluctuates with calcium/phosphorus, making it unreliable. 7-dehydrocholesterol is a skin precursor, vitamin D is not routinely measured, and vitamin D-binding protein is a carrier not indicative of status.\nAnswer: C","parsed_answer":"C","correct":true,"retrieval_context_hash":"80a7e272b93fff1239b39c0ae52ace31b305600e8bbc7c3c67a92096f961a6e4","retrieval_snapshot_id":"02ec77582542497f9e61ce78adbafda1","latency_ms":2191.89715385437,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7253920406759842,"rag_context_chars":5582,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":1.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Polyglutamates are the forms retained in various tissues or found in blood or bile and are the forms needed for function as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfer reactions. Folate catabolism involves the cleavage of intracellular and circulatory polyglutamates to the monoglutamate form. Approximately two-thirds of the folate in plasma is protein-bound, and albumin accounts for approximately 50% of the bound folate. Folates filter freely through the glomeruli and are secreted and reabsorbed by the renal tubules. The bulk of the urine excretory products are folate cleavage products, mainly in the monoglutamate form. Extensive enterohepatic circulation of folate occurs.84 The estimated total body folate content is between 12 and 28 mg, of which approximately 50% is in the liver.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nto all enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meal, pasta products, rice, and other cereal grain products sold in the United States.

Because preterm infants' suck-swallow-breathe coordination does not mature until 32 to 34 weeks of gestational age, they are dependent on tube feedings for up to 12 weeks.73 During this time of tube-feeding dependence, mothers must express their milk every 3 to 4 hours daily to provide adequate volume to feed their infant.61 Maintaining lactation during the often lengthy NICU stay is challenging for many mothers. Mother-infant separation, maternal illness that necessitated preterm delivery, family dynamics, lack of access to appropriate lactation counseling and support, socioeconomic status, transportation, and other factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nfactors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 Preterm MOM is preferred over other milk sources because of its unique nutrient density and bioactivity . It is imperative that mothers receive timely, appropriate, and continued lactation support and education throughout the NICU stay . Mothers who begin milk expression soon after delivery, preferably within 4 hours, will experience earlier lactogenesis and will sustain lactation longer.21 Immediate separation of mother and infant may compromise lactogenesis, but separation is often a medical necessity for preterm infants and mothers . In the preterm MOM-baby dyad, immediate lactation support to advance lactogenesis holds particular importance and requires collaboration from the labor and delivery staff and the NICU staff.31 Mothers require education on milk expression, access to hospital-grade electric breast pumps/supplies, and guidance on the safe handling and storage of expressed milk\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The reference context identifies the most common reasons for decreased established milk supply in pump-dependent mothers of preterm neonates as infrequent/ineffective pumping (causing milk stasis from incomplete emptying, matching option C), tight breast shield fit, and progestin-based contraception (B).

Because preterm infants' suck-swallow-breathe coordination does not mature until 32 to 34 weeks of gestational age, they are dependent on tube feedings for up to 12 weeks.73 During this time of tube-feeding dependence, mothers must express their milk every 3 to 4 hours daily to provide adequate volume to feed their infant.61 Maintaining lactation during the often lengthy NICU stay is challenging for many mothers. Mother-infant separation, maternal illness that necessitated preterm delivery, family dynamics, lack of access to appropriate lactation counseling and support, socioeconomic status, transportation, and other factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nfactors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 Preterm MOM is preferred over other milk sources because of its unique nutrient density and bioactivity . It is imperative that mothers receive timely, appropriate, and continued lactation support and education throughout the NICU stay . Mothers who begin milk expression soon after delivery, preferably within 4 hours, will experience earlier lactogenesis and will sustain lactation longer.21 Immediate separation of mother and infant may compromise lactogenesis, but separation is often a medical necessity for preterm infants and mothers . In the preterm MOM-baby dyad, immediate lactation support to advance lactogenesis holds particular importance and requires collaboration from the labor and delivery staff and the NICU staff.31 Mothers require education on milk expression, access to hospital-grade electric breast pumps/supplies, and guidance on the safe handling and storage of expressed milk\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The retrieved context explicitly states the most common reasons for decrease in established milk supply in pump-dependent mothers of preterm neonates are infrequent or ineffective pumping, breast shield with tight fit, and initiation of progestin-based contraception.

DHM has less abundant HMOs compared to mother's own milk (MOM).48\n ## Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and the Milk Fat Globule Membrane Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are biologically pertinent fatty acids from the essential fatty acid omega-3 precursor linolenic acid-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the essential fatty acid omega 6 fatty acid linoleic acid-arachidonic acid (ARA) respectively providing impacts on cognitive development.49 Maternal concentrations are very dependent on diet, and genetic guidance affects the amount of transfer to the baby through human milk.50 Recent imaging of infants with increased LCPUFA illustrated enhanced myelin in critical areas of the brain during development.51 For these reasons, it is important for the nutrition support team to also counsel mothers on the impact of dietary intake.52\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n. Higher amounts of DHA are safe, and human milk contains a wide range of DHA; however, research does not conclusively support the benefits of the higher level of DHA found in European formulas.35,39 ## Functional Ingredients in Infant Formulas\n ### DHA and ARA\n\nLong-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) have been shown to play an important role in the neuro-development of infants. DHA and ARA are the most abundant LCPUFAs in the brain; DHA is also found in retinal cells.41--43 DHA and ARA can be obtained from dietary sources or by the endogenous conversion of their precursors, α-linolenic acid (18:3 ω3) and linoleic acid (18:2 ω6).42,43 DHA and ARA occur naturally in human milk, with levels varying based on maternal diet.\n\nDuring pregnancy, DHA and ARA are transported across the placenta to the fetus.

Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease. Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease because of the rapid response of the calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands. Preterm neonates with a chronic depletion of calcium, which can occur via medications such as glucocorticoids, diuretics, and methylxanthines, may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. These patients also have hypophosphatemia but a low tubular reabsorption of phosphate. Serum calcium is not a sensitive marker in screening for metabolic bone disease of prematurity. 43. A.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\ncontraceptives, levothyroxine, insulin, prenatal vitamins) At the expense of the milk bank, donors also need to undergo serologic screening for HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis. ## 13.

Neonates who receive prolonged courses of parenteral nutrition are at risk for developing liver injury and cholestasis.¹ Enteral feedings stimulate bile flow, gallbladder contraction, and intestinal motility. Even trophic feedings can be beneficial in reducing the degree of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. If parenteral nutrition is continued in the presence of cholestasis, manganese and copper should be reduced and plasma levels monitored because these metals can accumulate to toxic levels in the cholestatic liver.

Studies have found that neonates who received human milk have decreased risk for infection. Providing a preterm neonate his or her own mother's milk is believed to be safe and efficacious. In the absence of mother's milk, however, banked human milk from donors may have similar safety and efficacy.

C. Having a donor human milk feeding practice in the neonatal intensive care unit has been associated with increased rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge. 398 --> Answers 57. C. Having a donor human milk feeding practice in the neonatal intensive care unit has been associated with increased rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge. Studies have found that a donor human milk feeding practice for preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit does not decrease mother's own milk¹ and leads to higher rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge.² However, there are challenges with using donor milk. For example, neonate growth can be poor because the donated milk typically is obtained from women who are lactating beyond 6 months when the nutrient concentration is lower.³ The amount of protein and zinc are lower in donor human milk than in mother's own milk.⁴\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The reference context directly identifies C as the correct answer, explaining that the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative requires training for all hospital staff working with newborns, which spills over to improve breastfeeding rates in the NICU despite the program's primary focus on nurseries.

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Pharmacol. 2008;21(2):381-385 31. D. The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown. However, this increase is transient, and treated neonates have similar calcium levels 24 hours after treatment compared with levels in untreated control neonates. Treatment can also blunt the increase in parathyroid hormone concentration that occurs on the first day after birth. The use of total parenteral nutrition with a higher calcium concentration during this period is impractical because calcium phosphate crystals can precipitate in the catheters.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\n24 hours after treatment than do untreated control neonates.

Thus, the current diet provided to these infants appears to be deficient in DHA. Preterm infants fed increased amounts of DHA have improved visual acuity and mental development.13,14 A multicenter prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in Italy compared 580 healthy term neonates receiving 20 mg of liquid DHA to 580 healthy term infants receiving a placebo with a focus on developmental milestones.15 The infants receiving DHA were able to sit without support 1 week earlier than the placebo group, but there was no difference in crawling, standing, or walking without assistance. It is unclear how these data from healthy term neonates relate to preterm neonates. For parenterally fed infants, the challenge to provide adequate DHA and ARA is even greater with the currently available intravenous lipid emulsions approved for use in this population.16\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nrequires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 requires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 Fatty acids and eicosanoids can also change the abundance of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression. Regulation of gene expression by nutrients is critically important in preterm neonates. Regulation of gene expression by ω-3 fatty acids involves multiple complex processes including regulation of the transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors that modulate many critical steps in metabolism.8,9 The 2 most abundant long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the brain are DHA and ARA.

Lysozyme is an acid-stable enzyme that has 300 times the concentration in human milk compared with cow's milk. Lysozyme is protective against gram-positive bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae.45 In addition to lactoferrin, sIgA, and lysozymes, many other bioactives in human milk act as anti-inflammatory agents and impart immunological benefits.

Abnormal bacterial proliferation is considered a likely factor in the development of NEC, especially in light of the presence of epidemic forms of the disease. F . Feeding, and its relationship to NEC, remain important areas of discussion . Since 90-95% of all infants who develop NEC have been fed, feeding is thought to play a role in NEC . However, the great majority of premature infants who are fed do not develop NEC . **The use of breast milk, and clear and consistent feeding algorithms are recommended as ways to reduce the incidence of NEC.** Lactoferrin, a normal component of human colostrum and milk, can enhance host defense and may be effective in the prevention of sepsis and NEC in preterm neonates . Implementation of a standardized feeding protocol utilizing human breast milk has been shown to be associated with a reduction of NEC and other morbidities in several studies and from several NICUs, including LPCH . Since growth and development is of extreme importance in the premature infant, initiation of feedings with breast milk should be considered at the earliest period feasible .

Pacifier sucking differs from sucking for nutritional intake. In pacifier sucking (nonnutritive sucking), the suck rate is twice as fast as nutritive sucking.25 The infant only has to balance breathing and swallowing until a critical volume of saliva has been collected that will trigger a pharyngeal swallow response. Therefore, infants participating in nonnutritive sucking swallow with significantly less frequency as compared to swallowing frequency during nutritive sucking. This also means that infants sucking on a pacifier do not have to tolerate a swallow apnea with every suck, thus explaining why many nonfeeding infants can non-nutritively suck but have difficulty when a nipple introduces liquid.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nto suck, swallow, and breathe in a coordinated manner is a developmental process.

Pacifier sucking differs from sucking for nutritional intake. In pacifier sucking (nonnutritive sucking), the suck rate is twice as fast as nutritive sucking.25 The infant only has to balance breathing and swallowing until a critical volume of saliva has been collected that will trigger a pharyngeal swallow response. Therefore, infants participating in nonnutritive sucking swallow with significantly less frequency as compared to swallowing frequency during nutritive sucking. This also means that infants sucking on a pacifier do not have to tolerate a swallow apnea with every suck, thus explaining why many nonfeeding infants can non-nutritively suck but have difficulty when a nipple introduces liquid.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nto suck, swallow, and breathe in a coordinated manner is a developmental process.

Which of the following statements regarding feeding and supplementation for preterm newborns is correct? A. Commercially available human milk fortifiers are limited to delivering similar levels of protein and carbohydrates as human milk but are unable to contain any phosphorus because of the risk of bacterial contamination.\nB. Milk derived from mothers who have given birth preterm typically has 3 times the phosphorus content of term human milk.\nC. Phosphorus absorption from human milk is less than 20% for preterm newborns.\nD. Soy milk proteins bind and release phosphorus preferentially in acidic environments, so soy-based formulas may be a useful therapy for newborns with low phosphorus levels.\nE. Most phosphorus absorption occurs through active and passive transport in the jejunum.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nhas been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom.

Manganese\nManganese is a trace element provided in neonatal parenteral nutrition. This compound activates specific enzymes (eg, superoxide dismutase), plays a role in bone structure, and assists with carbohydrate metabolism. A neonate who is deficient in manganese can develop dermatitis, hair depigmentation, growth failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive amounts can lead to basal ganglia injury as a result of manganese deposition.¹ Other trace elements have also been associated with toxicities,¹,² including the following:\n- Chromium (chronic renal failure)\n- Copper (cirrhosis of the liver)\n- Molybdenum (disruption of copper metabolism)\n- Zinc (decreased leukocyte and phagocyte activity) Excessive selenium has not been associated with toxicity.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\n0.01 mg ergocalciferol = 400 USP units.\nc 7 mg vitamin E = 7 USP units.

These are commercially available as single-entity products and in various multiple trace element combinations and concentrations for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients. It should be noted that the commercially available multiple trace element combinations in the United States contain 3–5 times the recommended dosages for manganese and may contribute to complications in long-term patients. See Table 4-6 for trace element supplementation for PN.²⁹⁻³¹ Other trace elements that may be supplemented in PN include molybdenum, iodine, and iron.²⁹ Three injectable iron products are available, all as single-entity products. Only iron dextran is approved for addition to PN admixtures, but this should only be considered for dextrose/amino acid (2-in-1) formulations because ILEs are disrupted by iron.³⁰ Table 4-6.

Trace elements commonly added to PN solutions include zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and chromium . For term infants requiring short (ie, &lt;2 weeks) courses of PN, it may not be necessary to provide them, but they should be provided to preterm neonates upon PN initiation . In particular, zinc and copper are necessary for growth, and serious complications have been reported when they have not been provided . Table 7-17 provides the typical doses of the most commonly supplemented trace elements . Because of biliary excretion of copper and manganese, these trace elements should be reduced in patients with cholestasis . Similarly, parenteral intake of selenium and chromium should be reduced or held in cases of renal dysfunction\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The retrieved context explicitly states that the most common clinical manifestation of zinc deficiency in neonates is a rash, typically located in the anogenital (perianal) area, matching option E (perianal dermatitis).

The mother has expressed a small amount of colostrum and breast milk. Which of the following is an appropriate aspect of nutrition management for this neonate? A. Because parenteral nutrition provides adequate nutrition at this stage during the first week after delivery, enteral feedings should be withheld until 4 to 6 days after delivery to avoid increasing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nB. During the course of hospitalization for this preterm neonate, neonate formula should be used only in cases when the mother has HIV or hepatitis infection.\nC.

Magnesium plays a critical role in the functioning of the Na^{+}-K^{+}-ATPase pump, thus affecting neuromuscular transmission, cardiovascular excitability, vasomotor tone, and muscle contraction. Magnesium is also an integral component of bone and parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Magnesium is found primarily in the ICF, with only about 2% of total body stores found in the ECF. More than 50% of the magnesium in the body resides in bone. About 61% of serum magnesium is physiologically active in the ionized form, 33% protein bound, and 5% complexed to phosphate, citrate, and other compounds.49,50\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\na protein-bound (~30%) and an ultrafiltrable (~70%) portion.

Magnesium plays a critical role in the functioning of the Na^{+}-K^{+}-ATPase pump, thus affecting neuromuscular transmission, cardiovascular excitability, vasomotor tone, and muscle contraction. Magnesium is also an integral component of bone and parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Magnesium is found primarily in the ICF, with only about 2% of total body stores found in the ECF. More than 50% of the magnesium in the body resides in bone. About 61% of serum magnesium is physiologically active in the ionized form, 33% protein bound, and 5% complexed to phosphate, citrate, and other compounds.49,50\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\na protein-bound (~30%) and an ultrafiltrable (~70%) portion.

It is critical for normal ATP function and glucose metabolism, and it is necessary for both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Mg is also important in cellular cytoskeleton contraction and at the myoneural junction; in this role, it can alter skeletal and cardiac muscle function. Among numerous other cell functions, Mg catalyzes enzymatic processes for the transfer, storage, and use of energy and regulates movement of potassium and Ca across cell membranes.

Newer supplements with better tolerance and bioavailability are being developed.[21] ## Absorption, Excretion, and Metabolism Gastric acid aids in the digestion of Ca from natural or Ca-fortified food or drink. Some Ca compounds, such as calcium citrate, are better absorbed than calcium carbonate in individuals with decreased gastric acid. About 90% of the Ca absorbed is through the small intestine, and the large intestine can absorb the remainder.[23] Dietary Ca absorption, particularly in young children, is primarily regulated by Ca rather than vitamin D intake.[1,2,24-26] At high dietary Ca intake, paracellular absorption takes place throughout the small intestine and depends on the concentration gradient. At low Ca intake, transcellular absorption takes place largely in the duodenum and is dependent on 1,25(OH)₂D.[27] The role of 1,25(OH)₂D in epithelial transport, including TABLE 6-2.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

In human studies, casein-predominant formulas result in lower zinc bioavailability than whey-predominant formulas, presumably because of less casein digestion.22 Other types of human whey proteins include secretory IgA and lactoferrin.21 Secretory IgA attaches to the lining of the GI tract and prevents potential pathogenic microorganisms from adhering.9 Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that limits the ability of bacteria to thrive in the intestines. Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nUnited Kingdom: Cambridge University Press; 2006:281-283\n2.

Donated human milk after pasteurization is essentially the same as current preterm formula in both biological and nutrient content. C. Donor milk has higher energy content after pasteurization than does raw milk. D. Pasteurization may reduce the amount and activity of lysozyme in donor milk compared with those in mother's own milk. E. Secretory immunoglobulin A remains at the same level of quantity and quality in donor milk, when pasteurized using current methods, as in mother's own milk. Source: Valentine CJ, Dumm M.

Concentrations of lactoferrin decrease over time and settle at 180 mg/dL by 5 months of lactation.38 Lactoferrin is necessary for iron absorption from human milk and is affected by maternal protein-energy malnutrition.40 Mothers who are protein-energy malnourished but not iron-deficient are lactoferrin-deficient.15\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nof amino acids into circulation.

Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: ASPEN context specifies lactoferrin at 600 mg/dL in colostrum, decreasing to 180 mg/dL by 5 months in mature milk; hind breast milk aligns with transitional/mature stages (lower than colostrum).

Exceeding the glucose oxidation or glucose infusion rate results in fat production, a consequence that may be desired in the short term for some patients, such as very low birth weight preterm neonates.²⁵ However, excess glucose provision has been associated with hepatic steatosis and should be avoided in long-term PN patients at risk for IFALD.²³,²⁵,²⁶\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The reference context from NeoReviews explicitly states for preterm neonates receiving PN: initial glucose rate 4-6 mg/kg/min, daily increase 1-2 mg/kg/min, maximal rate 12 mg/kg/min, matching option D precisely (question 62 answer).

Therefore, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are required in the human diet and are termed \"essential fatty acids.\"1 The shortest chain ω-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid (LA). Humans can convert LA to arachidonic acid (ARA). The shortest chain ω-3 fatty acid is α-linolenic acid (αLA). Humans can convert αLA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and convert EPA very slowly to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The same enzyme pool is used to metabolize LA and αLA to their respective longer-chain metabolites. The more prevalent fatty acid is preferentially metabolized. Thus, with a diet high in the ω-6 fatty acid LA, LA will be preferentially metabolized over the ω-3 fatty acid αLA. ARA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-6) and EPA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-3) are released from membranes and further metabolized to a cascade of eicosanoids. Although it is not quite so simple, eicosanoids from ω-6 fatty acids are generally considered proinflammatory and those from ω-3 fatty acids are considered weakly anti-inflammatory. The docosanoid products of DHA also have anti-inflammatory actions.3\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nrequires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 requires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 Fatty acids and eicosanoids can also change the abundance of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression.

Therefore, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are required in the human diet and are termed \"essential fatty acids.\"1 The shortest chain ω-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid (LA). Humans can convert LA to arachidonic acid (ARA). The shortest chain ω-3 fatty acid is α-linolenic acid (αLA). Humans can convert αLA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and convert EPA very slowly to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The same enzyme pool is used to metabolize LA and αLA to their respective longer-chain metabolites. The more prevalent fatty acid is preferentially metabolized. Thus, with a diet high in the ω-6 fatty acid LA, LA will be preferentially metabolized over the ω-3 fatty acid αLA. ARA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-6) and EPA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-3) are released from membranes and further metabolized to a cascade of eicosanoids. Although it is not quite so simple, eicosanoids from ω-6 fatty acids are generally considered proinflammatory and those from ω-3 fatty acids are considered weakly anti-inflammatory. The docosanoid products of DHA also have anti-inflammatory actions.3\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nrequires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 requires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 Fatty acids and eicosanoids can also change the abundance of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression. Regulation of gene expression by nutrients is critically important in preterm neonates. Regulation of gene expression by ω-3 fatty acids involves multiple complex processes including regulation of the transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors that modulate many critical steps in metabolism.8,9 The 2 most abundant long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the brain are DHA and ARA. DHA is concentrated in the prefrontal cortex and some retinal cells.10 Inadequate intake of ω-3 fatty acids not only results in decreased brain DHA but also increased brain --- <!-- Page 61 -->\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The reference context explicitly states that resolvin D1 and protectin D1 are derived from docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n-3), matching question 63.

Using products that contain these preformed EFAs may be beneficial in this population, but evidence is still lacking. Serum triglyceride (TG) levels should be monitored for ILE tolerance. The goal is to have serum TG levels less than 250 mg/dL. Infants prone to hypertriglyceridemia should have their lipids infused over 24 hours at an ILE infusion rate not to exceed 0.15–0.17 g/kg/h (depending on ILE product).³¹ Because of low amounts of lipoprotein lipase in their capillary epithelium that facilitates TG metabolism, infants may benefit from the addition of heparin to the PN at 0.5–1 U/mL of PN to induce the enzyme and improve clearance.³² The addition of the lysine derivative levocarnitine has also been shown to help manage hypertriglyceridemia by transporting long-chain TGs across the cell membrane into the mitochondria.³³\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby reducing VLDL levels. However, elevated TG levels have been reported in all sources of ILE. Other oil sources include the combination of soybean, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), olive, and fish. ## Carnitine and Heparin\n\nCarnitine is responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation to produce energy. Therefore, carnitine can aid in reducing TG levels. However, carnitine is not present in PN solutions and may need to be added if deficiency is present, indicated by free carnitine blood levels &lt;8.0 mmol/L. Neonates born prior to 32 to 34 weeks of gestation have been found to be carnitine-deficient because carnitine accretion happens in the last trimester of gestation.⁴⁰ Supplementation as high as 5 to 10 mg/kg/d has been used in patients with elevated TG levels and those on PN longer than 7 days. If carnitine deficiency is present, then up to 50 mg/kg/d may be needed.⁴¹\n\nHeparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase activity by degrading TGs into fatty acid and glycerol. This activity is depressed in preterm infants.

Lipoprotein lipase in the capillary endothelium releases free fatty acids, which are delivered to tissues by chylomicrons . The fatty acids are carried in the blood bound to albumin and are delivered to the tissues to use for fuel . When fatty acids are used for fuel, they are activated to the fatty acyl-CoA at the outer mitochondrial membrane .

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nand on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ and on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ # References 1.

Folate supplementation has been implicated in delayed diagnosis of pernicious anemia until after irreversible neurological damage has occurred.83,86 These risks are increased in cases of reduced hepatic transformation of folic acid (eg, caused by genetic variants or during some pharmacotherapies). 5-MTHF may be a better alternative to folic acid supplementation because it is immediately available as a methyl donor in many metabolic reactions. Additionally, it does not accumulate in blood\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 120 -->\n\nlike folic acid does in cases of reduced hepatic transformation.

Cysteine\nCysteine is required for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, helps to maintain redox potential, and assists with calcium homeostasis. In newborns, cysteine is a semiessential amino acid because of impaired cysteine production.¹ As a result, cysteine is routinely added to amino acid preparations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of its poor solubility, cysteine is often added last to the amino acid solution. References\n1.  Van Goudoever JB, Sulkers EJ, Timmerman M, et al.

Glutathione\n\nMultiple antioxidant systems, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic, have evolved to counteract oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important nonenzymatic intracellular antioxidant. GSH molecules form a disulfide bond to form oxidized GSH (GSSG) and in the process serve as electron donors, leading to reduction of disulfide bonds. Glutathione reductase then reduces GSSG back to GSH by using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor. Other nonenzymatic antioxidants include transferrin and ceruloplasmin, which can bind transition metals, as well as free radical quenchers, such as uric acid and bilirubin.\n\nEnzymatic pathways of defense against free radical injury include the superoxide dismutase family of antioxidant enzymes, catalases, GSH peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.¹ Newborns, particularly those born preterm, are at increased risk of oxidative stress because of an immature antioxidant system.¹,²\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ncholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 Selenium is critical for antioxidant capacity, primarily through glutathione peroxidase, for immune function, and as a cofactor for thyroid hormone production and regulation; needs may be increased with critical illness and thermal injury.55,63 Selenium deficiency may present as cardiomyopathy (ie, Keshan disease), myalgias, myositis, hemolysis, and impaired cellular immunity.55,63\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The key clinical concept is the nutrient that serves as a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), an enzymatic antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress in preterm neonates.

While intermittent oral feeds may be a successful strategy, often a more rapid transition from PN to EN is achieved with continuous gastric feeds that are then transitioned to bolus and oral feeds. Certainly, oral feeds can be added on top of continuous feeds to allow the infant to acquire oral motor skills. The more complicated infants have greater duodenal dysmotility and may have required a tapering enteroplasty; they often have a G-tube inserted to facilitate gastric decompression, thereby protecting the anastomosis, and allowing the infant greater success in extubating from mechanical ventilation without a nasogastric tube in place.

For neonates with difficulty latching or maintaining a seal, a nipple shield, proper head support, and proper positioning are helpful. Neonates with a disorganized sucking, swallowing, and breathing sequence may benefit from swaddling to assist with state regulation, cue-based feedings, and pacing.
