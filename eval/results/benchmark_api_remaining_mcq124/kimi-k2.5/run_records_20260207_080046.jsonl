Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W.

However, until an optimal multitrace element product is developed, one mechanism for dose-adjusting trace elements based on age-specific or disease-specific needs is to supplement PN solutions with copper, selenium, and zinc using the single-entity products instead of the multitrace element products. Thus, accumulation of chromium and manganese can be avoided. For institutions using multitrace element products, supplemental zinc may be required in certain patients, such as preterm infants and those with increased GI losses.

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Option B correctly identifies standard clinical targets: maintaining protein intake around 4 g/kg/day, plasma glucose between 54–106 mg/dL (3–6 mmol/L) to avoid hypo- and hyperglycemia, and plasma triglycerides <250 mg/dL to ensure lipid tolerance.

Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant?

This caution is emphasized in a recent ASPEN position paper.14 Often, nonprotein calories of 60 to 80 kcal/kg/d, perhaps even less, are sufficient to meet initial neonate goals.15 Documented studies indicate that preterm neonates often require a generous protein supply, perhaps as high as 4 g/kg/d, which primarily provides a substrate for tissue repair but does not independently prevent catabolism of the existing muscle mass. Counting this protein delivery as energy-yielding caloric intake may result in inadequate caloric provision; this is the basis for calculating and targeting nonprotein calories in the acute perioperative setting. To provide an optimal substrate for nutrient assimilation, a nonprotein calorie-to-nitrogen ratio of 130:1 to 210:1 is generally recommended as the target PN solution.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nwhich prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria. Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? which prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria. Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

Although the incidence is low, several potential complications are associated with ILE use, such as infusion-related adverse reactions and allergy to the ILE components . Depending on the length of the PN therapy and the nutrition status of the patient, ILE-free PN may result in essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) . Two polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and α-linolenic acid, cannot be synthesized by the body and are considered essential . Clinical manifestations of EFAD include scaly dermatitis, alopecia, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, fatty liver, and anemia.10 Biochemical evidence of EFAD is determined by a triene-to-tetraene ratio of >0.2 and can occur within 1--3 weeks in adults receiving ILE-free PN.11 The adult requirements for linoleic acid are met through exogenous sources or endogenously through the lipolysis of adipose tissue\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nAcid (EFA) Deficiency Monitoring: EFA deficiency may develop in 1-3 weeks on no/low exogenous EFA delivery.

Bone mineralization is improved in preterm infants given mineral-rich preterm and postdischarge formulas compared to standard term formulas. However, this may not persist into adulthood.205 Human milk with human milk fortifier is currently recommended for small preterm infants because it can preserve the beneficial nutrition and immunological effects of human milk while providing additional energy, protein, minerals, and other micronutrients. Preterm formula (vs term formula) is recommended for formula-fed preterm infants. However, there is no evidence indicating that postdischarge formulas improve developmental outcomes more than standard term formulas after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, in the smallest infants, postdischarge formulas have been observed to enhance head growth. Data from Ehrenkranz et al regarding the positive developmental outcome of encouraging early growth in preterm infants advise against any go-slow approach for these infants to possibly reduce markers of future cardiovascular risk (to values below those observed in healthy term infants).206\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nJ, Garcia AL, Mactier H, Edwards CA.

As such, they reflect current advances in prenatal care.13,14 Newborn term and preterm infants are classified by birth weight (see Table 30-2) and gestational age (GA) .

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: 9_AcidBaseDisorders.md]\nNUTRITION SUPPORT\nCERTIFICATE Upon admission to the hospital and continuation of PN, what change should be made based on RK's ABG? to multiple days of high volume emesis.\n- Laboratory values:\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nand the neonate will become catabolic and break down their protein stores for energy. Neonates with severe respiratory failure, congenital heart defects, or NEC often receive PN initially.66 ## Compounding PN for the Neonate In addition to the calcium and phosphorus compatibility issues, other compounding factors have been the focus of recent attention in hopes of preventing PN-related complications in the neonate. These include minimizing aluminum exposure, protecting the solutions from light, and avoidance of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate--containing materials. Preterm infants and children with intestinal failure have immature or diminished antioxidant defenses that render them more susceptible to oxidant stress that can influence the selection of many PN additives.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The neonate demonstrates signs of hemoconcentration and prerenal azotemia (BUN 40, Cr 0.81, urine output 0.8 mL/kg/hr) requiring increased fluid administration to 125 mL/kg/day.

Expression of human milk impacts nutrients such as fat, which can be variable based on milk expression timing; vitamin C, which is vulnerable to light exposure; and bioactive ingredients, which may be diminished during freezing.112,113 Healthcare facilities should prepare, store, and deliver human milk safely to protect and preserve the milk. Accurate track-and-trace systems must also be in place to prevent incorrect administration of human milk.113,114\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby mixing each feed with an HMF or preterm formula. Clinicians should include the family when planning prescriptions. For a parent-centered algorithm to use at discharge, see Figure 11-3. ## Term Infants Hospitalized term infants often have a diagnosis that impacts nutrient requirements, absorption, and delivery. As with preterm infants, hospitalized term infants are separated from their mothers and may undergo surgery and/or intubation, which may temporarily prevent direct breastfeeding. The provision of expressed MOM is important to protect these infants from common infections in immunocompromised infants. Human milk fortification is necessary for term infants who have fluid restrictions (<140 mL/kg/d);increased energy needs (with cardiac or pulmonary disorders); andexcess nutrient losses or poor absorption from diuretic use, ostomies (colostomy, jejunostomy, thoracostomy), dialysis, cystic fibrosis, hepatic, or renal failure.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nbe required to meet the nutritional needs of this vulnerable population.

Clinical decisions to adjust the enteral feeding regimen are determined by several factors, primarily stool or ostomy output, evidence of malabsorption, and other less objective symptoms such as abdominal fullness, irritability, and regurgitation. Currently, decisions related to advancing enteral feeding, weaning PN, and long-term monitoring of patients at risk for growth failure are based almost completely on experience, tradition, and art rather than evidence-based algorithms. However, institutions have created feeding protocols to standardize their own practice with excellent results at expediting PN-weaning and reducing IF-associated liver disease (IFALD) incidence.49 The understanding of the relative importance of these factors, how they are incorporated into daily management, and how they impact adaptation in patients with IF is critical if the management of infants with IF is to move beyond art and tradition and into an evidence-based practice of medicine.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nhas been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom.

Nutrition considerations in these infants focus on the provision of adequate PN calories via central access, with early contemplation of techniques to limit cholestatic disorders. This is necessary because the process of completing the conversion to enteral feeds may be prolonged by dysmotility and complications such as NEC. With the intent to gradually stimulate the bowel for adaptation, continuous feeds are most often initiated, and the infants (who often have G-tubes to facilitate this) are allowed to sham-feed by mouth and are eventually converted later to full bolus feeds by mouth or G-tube.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: This 24-week infant with surgical NEC has prolonged PN dependence (multiple NPO periods, ostomy) placing them at risk for PN-associated cholestasis/hepatocellular injury (A), metabolic bone disease, and anemia (B) from prolonged intravenous nutrition, and central line-associated bloodstream infections (C) from requisite vascular access.

Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant?

For example, 10% dextrose infusing at 10 mL/h in a 3 kg infant is calculated as follows: 10 × (1/100 mL) × (1000 mg/1 g) × (10 mL/h) × (1 h/60 min) × (1/3 kg) = 5.6 mg/kg/min\nAdditional calories are provided by phospholipid emulsifiers and glycerol.\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\n(PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium:Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride:Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr (PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium:Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride:Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr Parenteral nutrition therapy day # 10\nDosing weight: 0.87 kgs.

For example, 10% dextrose infusing at 10 mL/h in a 3 kg infant is calculated as follows: 10 × (1/100 mL) × (1000 mg/1 g) × (10 mL/h) × (1 h/60 min) × (1/3 kg) = 5.6 mg/kg/min\nAdditional calories are provided by phospholipid emulsifiers and glycerol.\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\n(PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium:Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride:Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr (PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium:Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride:Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr Parenteral nutrition therapy day # 10\nDosing weight: 0.87 kgs.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\npreterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n ### Calcium and phosphorus The provision of adequate calcium and phosphorus in an optimal ratio is important for bone mineralization in neonates and infants, particularly those born preterm since maximum calcium and phosphorus accretion rates occur over the last 6 weeks of gestation. While solubility limits within PN solutions prohibit the supply of minerals provided in utero during the last trimester (6–7.5 mEq/kg/d calcium and 2.3–2.7 mmol/kg/d phosphorus), providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of 1.7 mg calcium to 1 mg phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary TABLE 33-4.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Amylose is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple glucose units.\n2. The correct answer is C. The breakdown of sugars, especially lactose, lipids, and proteins is required to nourish the infant. Amylases would be used to break down complex starches; human milk does have HMOs and complex carbohydrates, but these are not digested by humans and are not necessary for infant nutrition.\n3. The correct answer is B. It is hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose.\n4. The correct answer is B. Lactase activity at the start of the third trimester is &lt;25% of that at term.\n5. The correct answer is D. Low amylase activity could result in the malabsorption of the rice cereal, which is a starch, with a resultant increase in osmotic drag from the poorly absorbed carbohydrate and the passage of the malabsorbed carbohydrate into the colon where it is fermented to SCFAs.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 57 -->\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ntrimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> process, also known as primary lactase deficiency or primary hypolactasia, commonly begins between 3 and 5 years of age and continues into adulthood.18 The prevalence of hypolactasia varies across ethnic populations as follows: 90% Asian, 80% Black, 53% Hispanic, and 15% to 25% non-Hispanic White.18 The role of variable digestive capacity for lactose in the development of illness among neonates is of uncertain significance. Studies conducted in preterm pigs suggest that incomplete digestion of carbohydrates may be linked to the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis.19 Additionally, the time until full feeding tolerance is inversely related to lactase activity (see Figure 3-3).16,20\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nhigh throughout life. Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency is a relatively rare (1/5000) autosomal recessive disorder in which patients lack sucrase and have variable isomaltase activity.15 ## Lactose Lactase is the enzyme responsible for digesting lactose, which is the primary carbohydrate in human milk and most infant formulas. Lactase hydrolyzes the disaccharide lactose into monosaccharides glucose and galactose (see Figure 3-2).3,5 Like maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, lactase is located along the brush border of the enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. Because the optimum pH for lactase activity is 6.0, its activity is highest in the jejunum and decreases toward the ileum.12 This gradient is established by 11 weeks of gestation.10 During gestation, lactase activity increases until birth, with the greatest increase occurring during the third trimester. At the beginning of the third trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 -->\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The retrieved context from Averys Neonatology explicitly states: \"Lactase activity in infant <34 weeks' gestation is 30% of normal term infant.\" While the ASPEN Pediatric Nutrition Support Core Curriculum notes that lactase activity at the beginning of the third trimester is approximately 25% of term levels, the specific query regarding infants less than 34 weeks' gestation is directly answered by the 30% figure provided in the Averys source.\n\nAnswer: C","parsed_answer":"C","correct":true,"retrieval_context_hash":"8f48924cab2662b6c3a10025d829abe87268f0f05395d1d6485efb6deabc248d","retrieval_snapshot_id":"60c4e4c4c5a94efcb45e3c532a3e0ae9","latency_ms":10170.241117477417,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7284094766546887,"rag_context_chars":5864,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":1.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Amylose is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple glucose units.\n2. The correct answer is C. The breakdown of sugars, especially lactose, lipids, and proteins is required to nourish the infant. Amylases would be used to break down complex starches; human milk does have HMOs and complex carbohydrates, but these are not digested by humans and are not necessary for infant nutrition.\n3. The correct answer is B. It is hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose.\n4. The correct answer is B. Lactase activity at the start of the third trimester is &lt;25% of that at term.\n5. The correct answer is D. Low amylase activity could result in the malabsorption of the rice cereal, which is a starch, with a resultant increase in osmotic drag from the poorly absorbed carbohydrate and the passage of the malabsorbed carbohydrate into the colon where it is fermented to SCFAs.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 57 -->\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ntrimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> process, also known as primary lactase deficiency or primary hypolactasia, commonly begins between 3 and 5 years of age and continues into adulthood.18 The prevalence of hypolactasia varies across ethnic populations as follows: 90% Asian, 80% Black, 53% Hispanic, and 15% to 25% non-Hispanic White.18 The role of variable digestive capacity for lactose in the development of illness among neonates is of uncertain significance.

Lactase hydrolyzes the disaccharide lactose into monosaccharides glucose and galactose (see Figure 3-2).3,5 Like maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, lactase is located along the brush border of the enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine.

In the United States, Intralipid is the primary commercial product used to provide lipids to neonates. This is a soybean-based oil with a high amount of omega-6 fatty acids (eg, linoleic acid) and phytosterols; this latter component is associated with cholestasis.¹ Other potential lipid emulsions being explored for commercial use contain fish oil, which has a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids (eg, docosahexaenoic acid) that may minimize the risk of liver disease.² A prolonged period of lipid infusion (&gt;2 weeks) can increase the risk of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.³ If a neonate who is receiving a lipid solution develops cholestasis, the lipid solution should be decreased, while protein and/or glucose supplementation should be increased to avoid caloric deprivation.⁴\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nless than 1250 g.

Multiple studies have shown that postnatal nutritional strategies for preterm neonates are unable to achieve the intrauterine accretion rates of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).¹,² The soybean-based Intralipid emulsion contains high amounts of linoleic acid (LA) but smaller amounts of LCPUFAs. When this lipid solution is administered in preterm neonates in the first week after birth, neonates' levels of LA increase with a decrease in DHA¹; these disturbances persist for more than 1 month despite enteral interventions. Even if DHA is administered enterally, preterm neonates have absorption rates of 70% to 80% and inefficient ability for hydrolysis of lipids.³\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

Figure 1-1 illustrates the typical swallow sequencing in a bottle-feeding infant. ## Feeding Skills in the First Year The typical newborn is ready to feed shortly after birth . The reflexive root allows the infant to open the mouth, turn toward the food source, latch, and begin to suckle . The newborn will suckle, swallow, and breathe in a rhythmic sequence . This pattern is established through early reflexes that develop in utero, and the efficiency of this pattern improves by the third day of life.23 The rooting reflex is among the most important and is activated by a light touch on or near the infant's mouth . Once latched onto the nipple, the infant's tongue and jaw work together to express milk.24 The infant will feed in a burst-pause pattern that is usually quite regular, with the bursts being suck-swallow-and-breathe cycles and the pauses being brief and regular rest periods . Bursts of 8 sucks or more are seen in the typical newborn.25 Sensing changes in the nipple, the infant can vary the sucking pressure quite easily to control the flow of milk\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nacids are important for the development and function of the nervous system.

The ASPEN Novel Nutrient Task Force recommends routine carnitine supplementation of 2 to 5 mg/kg/d to neonatal PN if no enteral source was provided.47 ### Cysteine Cysteine has been considered a conditionally essential amino acid in neonates and infants because of the enzymatic immaturity of the transsulfuration pathway responsible for the conversion of methionine to cysteine and ultimately to taurine.73 Cysteine is not a component of crystalline amino acid solutions because it is unstable and will form an insoluble precipitate.21 Common dosing for L-cysteine hydrochloride is 30 to 40 mg/g of pediatric amino acids; however, 20 mg/g may be adequate.74 In general, current practice suggests supplementation with L-cysteine hydrochloride for the first year of life, although actual practice varies widely.20 Riedijk et al75 have suggested that cysteine requirements are satisfied in 1-month-old preterm infants born at 32 weeks of gestation or older who are on a full enteral diet\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n<!-- Page 84 --> Herrera and Helms of parenteral and enteral nutrition in adult and pediatric patients.

It is extremely efficient, and a 10-minute to 15-minute whole-body exposure to peak summer sun will generate and release up to 500 mcg (20,000 IU) of vitamin D3 into the circulation.58,59 Cutaneous production of vitamin D3 is substantially diminished by decreased exposure to sunlight from seasonal changes or time of day, clouds, aerosols, thick ozone, higher latitude, aging, clothing, sunscreen use, and melanin pigmentation.59 In dark-skinned individuals, endogenous synthesis of vitamin D is possible, although the rate of production is lower than in less-pigmented individuals. Concerns regarding the hazards of ultraviolet radiation exposure have led to revised recommendations for sunlight exposure.60 Consequently, ensuring adequate vitamin D status, especially in the presence of factors that affect its endogenous synthesis, requires attention to dietary vitamin D supplementation.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The question tests knowledge of vitamin D metabolism and assessment.

Polyglutamates are the forms retained in various tissues or found in blood or bile and are the forms needed for function as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfer reactions. Folate catabolism involves the cleavage of intracellular and circulatory polyglutamates to the monoglutamate form. Approximately two-thirds of the folate in plasma is protein-bound, and albumin accounts for approximately 50% of the bound folate. Folates filter freely through the glomeruli and are secreted and reabsorbed by the renal tubules. The bulk of the urine excretory products are folate cleavage products, mainly in the monoglutamate form.

Because preterm infants' suck-swallow-breathe coordination does not mature until 32 to 34 weeks of gestational age, they are dependent on tube feedings for up to 12 weeks.73 During this time of tube-feeding dependence, mothers must express their milk every 3 to 4 hours daily to provide adequate volume to feed their infant.61 Maintaining lactation during the often lengthy NICU stay is challenging for many mothers. Mother-infant separation, maternal illness that necessitated preterm delivery, family dynamics, lack of access to appropriate lactation counseling and support, socioeconomic status, transportation, and other factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nfactors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 Preterm MOM is preferred over other milk sources because of its unique nutrient density and bioactivity .

DHM has less abundant HMOs compared to mother's own milk (MOM).48\n ## Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and the Milk Fat Globule Membrane Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are biologically pertinent fatty acids from the essential fatty acid omega-3 precursor linolenic acid-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the essential fatty acid omega 6 fatty acid linoleic acid-arachidonic acid (ARA) respectively providing impacts on cognitive development.49 Maternal concentrations are very dependent on diet, and genetic guidance affects the amount of transfer to the baby through human milk.50 Recent imaging of infants with increased LCPUFA illustrated enhanced myelin in critical areas of the brain during development.51 For these reasons, it is important for the nutrition support team to also counsel mothers on the impact of dietary intake.52\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n. Higher amounts of DHA are safe, and human milk contains a wide range of DHA; however, research does not conclusively support the benefits of the higher level of DHA found in European formulas.35,39 ## Functional Ingredients in Infant Formulas\n ### DHA and ARA\n\nLong-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) have been shown to play an important role in the neuro-development of infants. DHA and ARA are the most abundant LCPUFAs in the brain; DHA is also found in retinal cells.41--43 DHA and ARA can be obtained from dietary sources or by the endogenous conversion of their precursors, α-linolenic acid (18:3 ω3) and linoleic acid (18:2 ω6).42,43 DHA and ARA occur naturally in human milk, with levels varying based on maternal diet.\n\nDuring pregnancy, DHA and ARA are transported across the placenta to the fetus. Fetuses can synthesize DHA and ARA after 26 weeks of gestation, though the amount produced is highly variable.43 After birth, DHA and ARA are provided via human milk or infant formula supplemented with DHA and/or ARA. Infants fed formula without supplementation have been shown to have lower levels of DHA in the brain.43\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The retrieved context explicitly states that the highest amount of LCPUFAs in humans is found in the brain and retina, with the greatest concentration in the brain cortex occurring in synapses.

Lysozyme is an acid-stable enzyme that has 300 times the concentration in human milk compared with cow's milk. Lysozyme is protective against gram-positive bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae.45 In addition to lactoferrin, sIgA, and lysozymes, many other bioactives in human milk act as anti-inflammatory agents and impart immunological benefits. These immune health benefits are especially important for immunocompromised, hospitalized infants.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nosteopenia status.

Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease. Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease because of the rapid response of the calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands. Preterm neonates with a chronic depletion of calcium, which can occur via medications such as glucocorticoids, diuretics, and methylxanthines, may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. These patients also have hypophosphatemia but a low tubular reabsorption of phosphate. Serum calcium is not a sensitive marker in screening for metabolic bone disease of prematurity. 43. A.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\ncontraceptives, levothyroxine, insulin, prenatal vitamins) At the expense of the milk bank, donors also need to undergo serologic screening for HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis. ## 13.

Neonates who receive prolonged courses of parenteral nutrition are at risk for developing liver injury and cholestasis.¹ Enteral feedings stimulate bile flow, gallbladder contraction, and intestinal motility. Even trophic feedings can be beneficial in reducing the degree of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. If parenteral nutrition is continued in the presence of cholestasis, manganese and copper should be reduced and plasma levels monitored because these metals can accumulate to toxic levels in the cholestatic liver.

C. Having a donor human milk feeding practice in the neonatal intensive care unit has been associated with increased rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge. Studies have found that a donor human milk feeding practice for preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit does not decrease mother's own milk¹ and leads to higher rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge.² However, there are challenges with using donor milk. For example, neonate growth can be poor because the donated milk typically is obtained from women who are lactating beyond 6 months when the nutrient concentration is lower.³ The amount of protein and zinc are lower in donor human milk than in mother's own milk.⁴\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative requires that all hospital staff members working with newborns receive training in breastfeeding management and support.

Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? approach the mother to discuss feeding type, and she indicates that she plans to provide infant formula only. Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? A. Because there are several biologically plausible mechanisms for human milk's role in the prevention of NEC, such as antigen-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins, as well as multiple observational studies demonstrating a protective effect compared with the effects of infant formula, mother's own milk is the preferred feeding choice for this neonate. B. Donor milk and mother's own milk have the same composition of bioactive factors and have equivalent protective effect on NEC; therefore, this mother should not be encouraged to pump during the hospitalization if donor milk is available. C. Human milk may have an even more protective effect if pasteurized to eliminate potential pathogenic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Pasteurization (Holder method, 62.5°C for 30 minutes) reduces heat-sensitive bioactive factors.

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown.

DHA is concentrated in the prefrontal cortex and some retinal cells.10 Inadequate intake of ω-3 fatty acids not only results in decreased brain DHA but also increased brain --- <!-- Page 61 -->\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The key concept is that preterm neonates normally accrete long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as DHA and ARA at high rates in utero via placental transfer, but current postnatal nutritional strategies—whether parenteral or enteral—fail to match these intrauterine accretion rates. Standard soybean oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions (e.g., Intralipid) provide linoleic and α-linolenic acids but lack preformed DHA/ARA, and preterm infants have limited enzymatic capacity for conversion. Enteral feeds, including standard preterm formulas or unfortified breast milk, also typically provide insufficient DHA to match the rapid third-trimester accumulation. Therefore, preterm infants develop a progressive deficit in DHA and ARA compared to in-utero accretion. Option A is incorrect because breast milk DHA is well absorbed (not <20%) and would be the main source if enteral feeds were provided. Option B is incorrect because Intralipid is high in linoleic acid (LA) but lacks preformed LCPUFAs. Option D is incorrect because correcting DHA deficits requires weeks to months, not days. Option E is incorrect because LA levels are typically maintained or increased while DHA levels decline postnatally in preterm infants.\n\nAnswer: C","parsed_answer":"C","correct":true,"retrieval_context_hash":"005e05ff08e7e978526fd79c01fca3c010af57f6fe787b98fa8203d5de8aff30","retrieval_snapshot_id":"8e16480204b94301adbf2e5261132924","latency_ms":32024.13558959961,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7298530206909809,"rag_context_chars":4980,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":1.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Having a donor human milk feeding practice in the neonatal intensive care unit has been associated with increased rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge. Studies have found that a donor human milk feeding practice for preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit does not decrease mother's own milk¹ and leads to higher rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge.² However, there are challenges with using donor milk. For example, neonate growth can be poor because the donated milk typically is obtained from women who are lactating beyond 6 months when the nutrient concentration is lower.³ The amount of protein and zinc are lower in donor human milk than in mother's own milk.⁴\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\noutcomes.² Although a Cochrane review³ showed that cup feeding increased the chances of having some amount of breastfeeding at the time of discharge, it led to a longer period of hospitalization.\n ## References 1.

Lysozyme is an acid-stable enzyme that has 300 times the concentration in human milk compared with cow's milk. Lysozyme is protective against gram-positive bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae.45 In addition to lactoferrin, sIgA, and lysozymes, many other bioactives in human milk act as anti-inflammatory agents and impart immunological benefits.

Abnormal bacterial proliferation is considered a likely factor in the development of NEC, especially in light of the presence of epidemic forms of the disease. F . Feeding, and its relationship to NEC, remain important areas of discussion . Since 90-95% of all infants who develop NEC have been fed, feeding is thought to play a role in NEC . However, the great majority of premature infants who are fed do not develop NEC . **The use of breast milk, and clear and consistent feeding algorithms are recommended as ways to reduce the incidence of NEC.** Lactoferrin, a normal component of human colostrum and milk, can enhance host defense and may be effective in the prevention of sepsis and NEC in preterm neonates . Implementation of a standardized feeding protocol utilizing human breast milk has been shown to be associated with a reduction of NEC and other morbidities in several studies and from several NICUs, including LPCH .

Pacifier sucking differs from sucking for nutritional intake. In pacifier sucking (nonnutritive sucking), the suck rate is twice as fast as nutritive sucking.25 The infant only has to balance breathing and swallowing until a critical volume of saliva has been collected that will trigger a pharyngeal swallow response. Therefore, infants participating in nonnutritive sucking swallow with significantly less frequency as compared to swallowing frequency during nutritive sucking. This also means that infants sucking on a pacifier do not have to tolerate a swallow apnea with every suck, thus explaining why many nonfeeding infants can non-nutritively suck but have difficulty when a nipple introduces liquid.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nto suck, swallow, and breathe in a coordinated manner is a developmental process.

In pacifier sucking (nonnutritive sucking), the suck rate is twice as fast as nutritive sucking.25 The infant only has to balance breathing and swallowing until a critical volume of saliva has been collected that will trigger a pharyngeal swallow response. Therefore, infants participating in nonnutritive sucking swallow with significantly less frequency as compared to swallowing frequency during nutritive sucking.

Manganese\nManganese is a trace element provided in neonatal parenteral nutrition. This compound activates specific enzymes (eg, superoxide dismutase), plays a role in bone structure, and assists with carbohydrate metabolism. A neonate who is deficient in manganese can develop dermatitis, hair depigmentation, growth failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive amounts can lead to basal ganglia injury as a result of manganese deposition.¹ Other trace elements have also been associated with toxicities,¹,² including the following:\n- Chromium (chronic renal failure)\n- Copper (cirrhosis of the liver)\n- Molybdenum (disruption of copper metabolism)\n- Zinc (decreased leukocyte and phagocyte activity) Excessive selenium has not been associated with toxicity.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\n0.01 mg ergocalciferol = 400 USP units.\nc 7 mg vitamin E = 7 USP units.

Magnesium plays a critical role in the functioning of the Na^{+}-K^{+}-ATPase pump, thus affecting neuromuscular transmission, cardiovascular excitability, vasomotor tone, and muscle contraction. Magnesium is also an integral component of bone and parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Magnesium is found primarily in the ICF, with only about 2% of total body stores found in the ECF. More than 50% of the magnesium in the body resides in bone. About 61% of serum magnesium is physiologically active in the ionized form, 33% protein bound, and 5% complexed to phosphate, citrate, and other compounds.49,50\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\na protein-bound (~30%) and an ultrafiltrable (~70%) portion.

It is critical for normal ATP function and glucose metabolism, and it is necessary for both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Mg is also important in cellular cytoskeleton contraction and at the myoneural junction; in this role, it can alter skeletal and cardiac muscle function. Among numerous other cell functions, Mg catalyzes enzymatic processes for the transfer, storage, and use of energy and regulates movement of potassium and Ca across cell membranes.

Fat**: Intravenous lipid emulsions are essential components of TPN. They provide essential fatty acids and are a concentrated energy source critical for growth and development of infants not receiving enteral feedings. There are potential safety concerns regarding administration of lipid emulsions to very low birth weight infants and infants with hyperbilirubinemia, pulmonary hypertension and serious pulmonary disease. To maximize benefits of lipids and minimize their adverse effects, use the following guidelines: (a) provide sufficient lipids to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency; (b) monitor for evidence of lipid intolerance; (c) adjust lipid dose based on clinical status.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nthe actual risk in preterm neonates is likely to be minimal because molar ratios of 4:1 to 5:1 of free fatty acids to albumin are required for significant changes in bilirubin binding. the actual risk in preterm neonates is likely to be minimal because molar ratios of 4:1 to 5:1 of free fatty acids to albumin are required for significant changes in bilirubin binding.

Some Ca compounds, such as calcium citrate, are better absorbed than calcium carbonate in individuals with decreased gastric acid. About 90% of the Ca absorbed is through the small intestine, and the large intestine can absorb the remainder.[23] Dietary Ca absorption, particularly in young children, is primarily regulated by Ca rather than vitamin D intake.[1,2,24-26] At high dietary Ca intake, paracellular absorption takes place throughout the small intestine and depends on the concentration gradient. At low Ca intake, transcellular absorption takes place largely in the duodenum and is dependent on 1,25(OH)₂D.[27] The role of 1,25(OH)₂D in epithelial transport, including TABLE 6-2.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

Concentrations of lactoferrin decrease over time and settle at 180 mg/dL by 5 months of lactation.38 Lactoferrin is necessary for iron absorption from human milk and is affected by maternal protein-energy malnutrition.40 Mothers who are protein-energy malnourished but not iron-deficient are lactoferrin-deficient.15\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nof amino acids into circulation.

Using products that contain these preformed EFAs may be beneficial in this population, but evidence is still lacking. Serum triglyceride (TG) levels should be monitored for ILE tolerance. The goal is to have serum TG levels less than 250 mg/dL. Infants prone to hypertriglyceridemia should have their lipids infused over 24 hours at an ILE infusion rate not to exceed 0.15–0.17 g/kg/h (depending on ILE product).³¹ Because of low amounts of lipoprotein lipase in their capillary epithelium that facilitates TG metabolism, infants may benefit from the addition of heparin to the PN at 0.5–1 U/mL of PN to induce the enzyme and improve clearance.³² The addition of the lysine derivative levocarnitine has also been shown to help manage hypertriglyceridemia by transporting long-chain TGs across the cell membrane into the mitochondria.³³\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby reducing VLDL levels. However, elevated TG levels have been reported in all sources of ILE. Other oil sources include the combination of soybean, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), olive, and fish. ## Carnitine and Heparin\n\nCarnitine is responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation to produce energy. Therefore, carnitine can aid in reducing TG levels. However, carnitine is not present in PN solutions and may need to be added if deficiency is present, indicated by free carnitine blood levels &lt;8.0 mmol/L. Neonates born prior to 32 to 34 weeks of gestation have been found to be carnitine-deficient because carnitine accretion happens in the last trimester of gestation.⁴⁰ Supplementation as high as 5 to 10 mg/kg/d has been used in patients with elevated TG levels and those on PN longer than 7 days. If carnitine deficiency is present, then up to 50 mg/kg/d may be needed.⁴¹\n\nHeparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase activity by degrading TGs into fatty acid and glycerol.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nand on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ and on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ # References 1.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations.

Folate supplementation has been implicated in delayed diagnosis of pernicious anemia until after irreversible neurological damage has occurred.83,86 These risks are increased in cases of reduced hepatic transformation of folic acid (eg, caused by genetic variants or during some pharmacotherapies). 5-MTHF may be a better alternative to folic acid supplementation because it is immediately available as a methyl donor in many metabolic reactions. Additionally, it does not accumulate in blood\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 120 -->\n\nlike folic acid does in cases of reduced hepatic transformation.

Glutathione\n\nMultiple antioxidant systems, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic, have evolved to counteract oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important nonenzymatic intracellular antioxidant. GSH molecules form a disulfide bond to form oxidized GSH (GSSG) and in the process serve as electron donors, leading to reduction of disulfide bonds. Glutathione reductase then reduces GSSG back to GSH by using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor. Other nonenzymatic antioxidants include transferrin and ceruloplasmin, which can bind transition metals, as well as free radical quenchers, such as uric acid and bilirubin.\n\nEnzymatic pathways of defense against free radical injury include the superoxide dismutase family of antioxidant enzymes, catalases, GSH peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.¹ Newborns, particularly those born preterm, are at increased risk of oxidative stress because of an immature antioxidant system.¹,²\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ncholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 Selenium is critical for antioxidant capacity, primarily through glutathione peroxidase, for immune function, and as a cofactor for thyroid hormone production and regulation; needs may be increased with critical illness and thermal injury.55,63 Selenium deficiency may present as cardiomyopathy (ie, Keshan disease), myalgias, myositis, hemolysis, and impaired cellular immunity.55,63\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Selenium is an essential trace element that serves as a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, the enzyme responsible for reducing hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides using glutathione as a substrate.

When human milk is not available, the choice of infant formula is based on gestational age. There are no predictable associated absorption disorders to require specialized formulas. The mode of feeding depends on the child's anatomic and functional considerations. While intermittent oral feeds may be a successful strategy, often a more rapid transition from PN to EN is achieved with continuous gastric feeds that are then transitioned to bolus and oral feeds.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nWhile intermittent oral feeds may be a successful strategy, often a more rapid transition from PN to EN is achieved with continuous gastric feeds that are then transitioned to bolus and oral feeds.

While intermittent oral feeds may be a successful strategy, often a more rapid transition from PN to EN is achieved with continuous gastric feeds that are then transitioned to bolus and oral feeds. Certainly, oral feeds can be added on top of continuous feeds to allow the infant to acquire oral motor skills. The more complicated infants have greater duodenal dysmotility and may have required a tapering enteroplasty; they often have a G-tube inserted to facilitate gastric decompression, thereby protecting the anastomosis, and allowing the infant greater success in extubating from mechanical ventilation without a nasogastric tube in place. Given the potentially complex and prolonged postoperative course in this disorder, PN is started routinely and converted to central formulation once central venous access has been established.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The retrieved context explicitly addresses this question, stating that for neonates with clinical instability during feedings, interventions such as cue-based feedings, slow-flow nipples, and pacing are recommended to establish more stable feedings.
