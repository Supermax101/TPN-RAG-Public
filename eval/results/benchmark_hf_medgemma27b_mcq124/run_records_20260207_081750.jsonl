Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W. We may infuse concentrations between D3W and D12.5W through a peripheral IV. Higher concentrations require central access. F.

In a suitably humidified environment, appropriate initial rates of IV fluid intake for the premature infant are: >28 wks gestation: 60-80 mL/kg\n26-28 wks gestation: 80-100 mL/kg\n<26 wks gestation: 100-120 mL/kg 5. These guidelines assume close monitoring of body weight, intake/output measurements, and serum sodium as noted above. 6. After the brisk diuresis that usually occurs during the first 3-7 days, urine output generally decreases to about 2-4 mL/kg/h, and fluid intake can be adjusted to about 120-150 mL/kg/d. 7. Once on full enteral nutrition, infants without evidence of CHF or renal dysfunction can almost always tolerated greater intake volumes, e.g., 160-180 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part2.md]\nlevels in utero that result in pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia.

Therefore, they may be relatively hyperinsulinemic at birth, resulting in higher than normal glucose requirements and hypoglycemia. E. Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W. We may infuse concentrations between D3W and D12.5W through a peripheral IV. Higher concentrations require central access. F.

However, until an optimal multitrace element product is developed, one mechanism for dose-adjusting trace elements based on age-specific or disease-specific needs is to supplement PN solutions with copper, selenium, and zinc using the single-entity products instead of the multitrace element products. Thus, accumulation of chromium and manganese can be avoided. For institutions using multitrace element products, supplemental zinc may be required in certain patients, such as preterm infants and those with increased GI losses. In addition, routine monitoring of copper in patients with cholestasis and of chromium and manganese in all patients is advised.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\namounts provided through contamination of other additives.

Important trace elements may also be neglected in the currently available products. Iodine, fluoride, and molybdenum are routinely supplemented in multitrace element preparations available outside the United States. Although iodine supplementation is not needed in patients on short-term PN, deficiency may occur in patients receiving chronic therapy especially since topical povidone-iodine is rarely used in dressings anymore.67 Deficiency of molybdenum has not been reported in pediatrics; however, one adult case of deficiency has been documented.47 TABLE 33-6.

Trace elements commonly added to PN solutions include zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and chromium . For term infants requiring short (ie, &lt;2 weeks) courses of PN, it may not be necessary to provide them, but they should be provided to preterm neonates upon PN initiation . In particular, zinc and copper are necessary for growth, and serious complications have been reported when they have not been provided . Table 7-17 provides the typical doses of the most commonly supplemented trace elements . Because of biliary excretion of copper and manganese, these trace elements should be reduced in patients with cholestasis .

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\nand generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: and generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: and generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: 1. Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively.

Within hours of delivery, a solution of protein (as amino acids, fat [in the form of ILE], and carbohydrates [as dextrose]) is administered until a customized PN can be compounded. Also, referred to as \"vanilla bags\" or \"day of life 1 PN,\" these solutions are started soon --- <!-- Page 232 --> after birth and are intended to prevent the catabolic processes that can result in additional muscle mass loss. These solutions provide sufficient energy and protein and sufficient calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. Typical starter PNs contain dextrose, amino acids, and calcium but are free of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively.

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings. Thus, for patients whose feedings are changing or at high risk for feeding intolerance, it may be better not to include the feeds in the daily PN order.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nassessing the triene-to-tetraene ratio for various age groups .

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus. Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n\n---\n[Source: UCSF Neonatal TPN.md]\n(DOL, day of life; pulm., pulmonary; PPHN, persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn; MAS meconium aspiration syndrome) 4. **Electrolyte requirements** are stated on the parenteral nutrition order form and must be adjusted according to serum values and clinical condition.

Specially formulated amino acid blends may be extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease). To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth. Infants only provided dextrose-containing fluids would continue to break down muscle mass that is difficult to regain.

Specially formulated amino acid blends may be extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease). To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth. Infants only provided dextrose-containing fluids would continue to break down muscle mass that is difficult to regain.

Protein requirements are estimated from fetal accretion rates and the intake required to achieve a rate of growth and body composition of a fetus of similar GA.[18] The optimal protein dose and composition for PN and EN are listed in Tables 7-7 and 7-8.[19] Human milk with added human milk fortifiers and preterm infant formulas will meet protein intake goals when infants are fed at least  $120\\mathrm{kcal / kg / d}$\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nwhich prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria.

Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

This caution is emphasized in a recent ASPEN position paper.14 Often, nonprotein calories of 60 to 80 kcal/kg/d, perhaps even less, are sufficient to meet initial neonate goals.15 Documented studies indicate that preterm neonates often require a generous protein supply, perhaps as high as 4 g/kg/d, which primarily provides a substrate for tissue repair but does not independently prevent catabolism of the existing muscle mass. Counting this protein delivery as energy-yielding caloric intake may result in inadequate caloric provision; this is the basis for calculating and targeting nonprotein calories in the acute perioperative setting. To provide an optimal substrate for nutrient assimilation, a nonprotein calorie-to-nitrogen ratio of 130:1 to 210:1 is generally recommended as the target PN solution.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nwhich prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria. Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? which prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria. Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

A neonate is born at 28 weeks' gestational age and has poor tone and respiratory effort after cesarean delivery for maternal indications, with maternal history of preeclampsia and fetal intolerance of labor. The Apgar score is 3 at 1 minute, 4 at 5 minutes, and 6 at 10 minutes. The newborn receives positive pressure ventilation and is intubated. The blood gas shows a metabolic and respiratory acidosis. What is the current status of evaluation and practice for preterm newborns and neonatal encephalopathy? A. Although the trials are still ongoing, due to the likelihood of benefit and low risk of harm, this patient should receive therapeutic hypothermia. B. An Apgar score of 7 or less at 5 minutes is highly predictive of moderate to severe cerebral palsy at 3-year follow-up.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\npregnant woman has been clinically thyrotoxic and has been receiving pharmacologic therapy .

Cord blood should be sent to test for free thyroxine as the main tool for evaluation of neonatal thyroid status.If the neonate's thyrotropin receptor antibody is greater than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , it is recommended that the neonate is kept under close observation for the first few days after birth , with particular attention paid to the heart rate and blood pressure.If the maternal thyrotropin receptor antibody has been negative , neonatal treatment with iodine should begin within the first hour while awaiting pending laboratory test results.To prevent false-positive results , laboratory testing in the neonate should be delayed for 1 to 2 weeks because serum levels of antibodies and thyroid function will primarily reflect placental passage of maternal hormones and antibodies.Regardless of the maternal history\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"0316d1a083939cd44cc80e89674d63efe10bf4b265854fbe7bdab5e62be95cb4","retrieval_snapshot_id":"7a6668bb9c1949f5b452f8384f50b485","latency_ms":157.88006782531738,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.6732418949741057,"rag_context_chars":4429,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Although the incidence is low, several potential complications are associated with ILE use, such as infusion-related adverse reactions and allergy to the ILE components . Depending on the length of the PN therapy and the nutrition status of the patient, ILE-free PN may result in essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) . Two polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and α-linolenic acid, cannot be synthesized by the body and are considered essential . Clinical manifestations of EFAD include scaly dermatitis, alopecia, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, fatty liver, and anemia.10 Biochemical evidence of EFAD is determined by a triene-to-tetraene ratio of >0.2 and can occur within 1--3 weeks in adults receiving ILE-free PN.11 The adult requirements for linoleic acid are met through exogenous sources or endogenously through the lipolysis of adipose tissue\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nAcid (EFA) Deficiency Monitoring: EFA deficiency may develop in 1-3 weeks on no/low exogenous EFA delivery.

His requirement for protein accretion for optimal growth is 3.5 to 4 g/kg/d. Extremely low-birth-weight neonates require 3.5 to 4 g/kg/d of protein to meet their caloric needs. Intravenous glucose infusions should be started at a rate of 5 to 6 mg/kg/min and could be increased up to 12 mg/kg/min. Beyond that amount, there may be resultant carbon dioxide retention, which could be an issue in neonates receiving ventilation. Extremely preterm neonates have a resting energy expenditure of approximately 50 kcal/kg/d, with a fecal energy loss of approximately 10 kcal/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nare not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants.16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements. are not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants.16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements. are not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants.16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements.

Bone mineralization is improved in preterm infants given mineral-rich preterm and postdischarge formulas compared to standard term formulas. However, this may not persist into adulthood.205 Human milk with human milk fortifier is currently recommended for small preterm infants because it can preserve the beneficial nutrition and immunological effects of human milk while providing additional energy, protein, minerals, and other micronutrients. Preterm formula (vs term formula) is recommended for formula-fed preterm infants. However, there is no evidence indicating that postdischarge formulas improve developmental outcomes more than standard term formulas after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, in the smallest infants, postdischarge formulas have been observed to enhance head growth. Data from Ehrenkranz et al regarding the positive developmental outcome of encouraging early growth in preterm infants advise against any go-slow approach for these infants to possibly reduce markers of future cardiovascular risk (to values below those observed in healthy term infants).206\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nJ, Garcia AL, Mactier H, Edwards CA.

Bone mineralization is improved in preterm infants given mineral-rich preterm and postdischarge formulas compared to standard term formulas. However, this may not persist into adulthood.205 Human milk with human milk fortifier is currently recommended for small preterm infants because it can preserve the beneficial nutrition and immunological effects of human milk while providing additional energy, protein, minerals, and other micronutrients. Preterm formula (vs term formula) is recommended for formula-fed preterm infants. However, there is no evidence indicating that postdischarge formulas improve developmental outcomes more than standard term formulas after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, in the smallest infants, postdischarge formulas have been observed to enhance head growth. Data from Ehrenkranz et al regarding the positive developmental outcome of encouraging early growth in preterm infants advise against any go-slow approach for these infants to possibly reduce markers of future cardiovascular risk (to values below those observed in healthy term infants).206\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nJ, Garcia AL, Mactier H, Edwards CA.

Extra-uterine growth restriction is an ongoing issue in the NICU. Neonates, particularly premature ones, whose nutritional needs are not met for a significant length of time, rapidly fall off their optimal growth curve. Even a short period without appropriate nutrition can result in protein, calcium, or phosphorus deficiencies that can be difficult to correct.

Preterm infants, especially those with extremely low birth weight (ELBW), are at high risk of extrauterine growth restriction. Given their immature development and body composition, their nutrition requirements exceed those of term infants. In infants with ELBW, developmental achievement and reduced neurological complications are associated with higher growth rates.

As such, they reflect current advances in prenatal care.13,14 Newborn term and preterm infants are classified by birth weight (see Table 30-2) and gestational age (GA) . The latter is calculated using the Ballard newborn maturational exam or by referencing the prenatal ultrasound or the date of the birthing parent's last menstrual period.15 Thereafter, serial longitudinal measurement of weight, length, and head circumference is the primary method for monitoring and assessing nutrition status and adequacy of growth . Low birth weight (LBW) characterizes infants with a birth weight <2500 g, regardless of gestational age; small for gestational age (SGA) or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) refers to newborns with birth weight <10th percentile for GA . LBW and SGA may result from preterm birth, restricted intrauterine growth, genetics, or a combination of multiple factors.16,17 Infants who are SGA at birth but have proportional reductions in weight, length, and head circumference are categorized as “symmetrical,” “proportional,” or “stunted” IUGR\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\n(VLBW) neonates.¹ Data from 2007 showed that late-onset sepsis occurred in 20% of VLBW neonates in the United States, whereas early-onset sepsis affected approximately 2% of this population.² --- (VLBW) neonates.¹ Data from 2007 showed that late-onset sepsis occurred in 20% of VLBW neonates in the United States, whereas early-onset sepsis affected approximately 2% of this population.² --- (VLBW) neonates.¹ Data from 2007 showed that late-onset sepsis occurred in 20% of VLBW neonates in the United States, whereas early-onset sepsis affected approximately 2% of this population.² --- <!-- Page 487 --> Infectious Diseases # References\n\n1.

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: 9_AcidBaseDisorders.md]\nNUTRITION SUPPORT\nCERTIFICATE Upon admission to the hospital and continuation of PN, what change should be made based on RK's ABG? to multiple days of high volume emesis.\n- Laboratory values:\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nand the neonate will become catabolic and break down their protein stores for energy. Neonates with severe respiratory failure, congenital heart defects, or NEC often receive PN initially.66 ## Compounding PN for the Neonate In addition to the calcium and phosphorus compatibility issues, other compounding factors have been the focus of recent attention in hopes of preventing PN-related complications in the neonate. These include minimizing aluminum exposure, protecting the solutions from light, and avoidance of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate--containing materials. Preterm infants and children with intestinal failure have immature or diminished antioxidant defenses that render them more susceptible to oxidant stress that can influence the selection of many PN additives.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"564536057f33097a5831d700694585d2927b3188af06a7176cf154bae62bd0c9","retrieval_snapshot_id":"c0572029722f4786b515f6843f80586e","latency_ms":156.42428398132324,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.6580849172500779,"rag_context_chars":5411,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Expression of human milk impacts nutrients such as fat, which can be variable based on milk expression timing; vitamin C, which is vulnerable to light exposure; and bioactive ingredients, which may be diminished during freezing.112,113 Healthcare facilities should prepare, store, and deliver human milk safely to protect and preserve the milk. Accurate track-and-trace systems must also be in place to prevent incorrect administration of human milk.113,114\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby mixing each feed with an HMF or preterm formula. Clinicians should include the family when planning prescriptions. For a parent-centered algorithm to use at discharge, see Figure 11-3. ## Term Infants Hospitalized term infants often have a diagnosis that impacts nutrient requirements, absorption, and delivery. As with preterm infants, hospitalized term infants are separated from their mothers and may undergo surgery and/or intubation, which may temporarily prevent direct breastfeeding. The provision of expressed MOM is important to protect these infants from common infections in immunocompromised infants. Human milk fortification is necessary for term infants who have fluid restrictions (<140 mL/kg/d);increased energy needs (with cardiac or pulmonary disorders); andexcess nutrient losses or poor absorption from diuretic use, ostomies (colostomy, jejunostomy, thoracostomy), dialysis, cystic fibrosis, hepatic, or renal failure.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nbe required to meet the nutritional needs of this vulnerable population.

Expression of human milk impacts nutrients such as fat, which can be variable based on milk expression timing; vitamin C, which is vulnerable to light exposure; and bioactive ingredients, which may be diminished during freezing.112,113 Healthcare facilities should prepare, store, and deliver human milk safely to protect and preserve the milk. Accurate track-and-trace systems must also be in place to prevent incorrect administration of human milk.113,114\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby mixing each feed with an HMF or preterm formula. Clinicians should include the family when planning prescriptions. For a parent-centered algorithm to use at discharge, see Figure 11-3. ## Term Infants Hospitalized term infants often have a diagnosis that impacts nutrient requirements, absorption, and delivery. As with preterm infants, hospitalized term infants are separated from their mothers and may undergo surgery and/or intubation, which may temporarily prevent direct breastfeeding. The provision of expressed MOM is important to protect these infants from common infections in immunocompromised infants. Human milk fortification is necessary for term infants who have fluid restrictions (<140 mL/kg/d);increased energy needs (with cardiac or pulmonary disorders); andexcess nutrient losses or poor absorption from diuretic use, ostomies (colostomy, jejunostomy, thoracostomy), dialysis, cystic fibrosis, hepatic, or renal failure.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nbe required to meet the nutritional needs of this vulnerable population.

Choice and mode of feeding are often determined by the infant's gestational maturity, the history of mucosal injury/disruption, the effectiveness of motility, the urgency to transition off PN, and the presence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER). In general, human milk should remain the first choice because of its qualities related to optimizing gut mucosal function and immunity.

Clinical decisions to adjust the enteral feeding regimen are determined by several factors, primarily stool or ostomy output, evidence of malabsorption, and other less objective symptoms such as abdominal fullness, irritability, and regurgitation. Currently, decisions related to advancing enteral feeding, weaning PN, and long-term monitoring of patients at risk for growth failure are based almost completely on experience, tradition, and art rather than evidence-based algorithms. However, institutions have created feeding protocols to standardize their own practice with excellent results at expediting PN-weaning and reducing IF-associated liver disease (IFALD) incidence.49 The understanding of the relative importance of these factors, how they are incorporated into daily management, and how they impact adaptation in patients with IF is critical if the management of infants with IF is to move beyond art and tradition and into an evidence-based practice of medicine.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nhas been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom.

Hypotension will result in splanchnic vasoconstriction, compromising mucosal flow to this vulnerable section of the bowel. Nutrition considerations in these infants focus on the provision of adequate PN calories via central access, with early contemplation of techniques to limit cholestatic disorders. This is necessary because the process of completing the conversion to enteral feeds may be prolonged by dysmotility and complications such as NEC. With the intent to gradually stimulate the bowel for adaptation, continuous feeds are most often initiated, and the infants (who often have G-tubes to facilitate this) are allowed to sham-feed by mouth and are eventually converted later to full bolus feeds by mouth or G-tube.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"96dd379b5bede056d852c021f8204998d4b321c3ffd01ac0a5b08c7f9395b763","retrieval_snapshot_id":"cf97306c9340485f8add2164e5c8380a","latency_ms":152.30679512023926,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7008574215983827,"rag_context_chars":5743,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

These issues are also discussed in Chapter 25, “Intestinal Failure.” As the infant enters the recovery phase without any infectious or wound-healing complications, the focus changes toward the more typical pediatric goals of nutrition support covering both acute needs and those for growth and development. At this point, documentation of weight gain, normalization of acute-phase reactants (eg, CRP), and establishment of increasing prealbumin values become the primary outcome measures. As mentioned previously, the focus on providing protein purely for wound-related anabolism is reduced at this point, and caloric provision should include protein-derived calories to avoid the complications of overfeeding.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nthere are disadvantages; there can be risk of high stoma output and salt and water loss.

Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg.

Thus, 0.1 mL/kg/hr delivers about 0.5 g/kg/day; 15 mL/kg/day delivers 3 g/kg/day, and 30 kcal/kg/day.

Once feedings of ≥ 80 mL/kg/d are achieved, the IL-20 rate should be restricted to 1 g/kg/day, and IL-20 may be stopped when feedings are ≥ 100-120 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\n: 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 : 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 Enteral feeding: 11 ml Q 3 hrs of Full strength Breast Milk/MBM\n(0.68 cal/ml) provides 67.4 Kcal/kg and 101.1 ml/kg\nTotal Kcals (all sources): 101.2 Kcal/kg\nGlucose Infusion Rate (PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium: Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride: Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr ethacin Patient Case: Day 9 to 10 TPN Ex-25w0d, birthweight 0.87 kg, RDS, PDA Parenteral nutrition therapy day # 9\nDosing weight: 0.87 kgs.

It is ordered in g/kg daily. IL-20 provides 0.2 g/mL of lipid, and 2 kcal/mL (9 kcal/g of lipid, and an additional 0.2 kcal/mL from glycerol). Thus, 0.1 mL/kg/hr delivers about 0.5 g/kg/day; 15 mL/kg/day delivers 3 g/kg/day, and 30 kcal/kg/day. Remember to wean the IL-20 as feedings advance, since fats make up most of the caloric content of milk. Once feedings of ≥ 80 mL/kg/d are achieved, the IL-20 rate should be restricted to 1 g/kg/day, and IL-20 may be stopped when feedings are ≥ 100-120 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\n: 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 : 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 Enteral feeding: 11 ml Q 3 hrs of Full strength Breast Milk/MBM\n(0.68 cal/ml) provides 67.4 Kcal/kg and 101.1 ml/kg\nTotal Kcals (all sources): 101.2 Kcal/kg\nGlucose Infusion Rate (PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium: Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride: Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr ethacin Patient Case: Day 9 to 10 TPN Ex-25w0d, birthweight 0.87 kg, RDS, PDA Parenteral nutrition therapy day # 9\nDosing weight: 0.87 kgs.

For example, 10% dextrose infusing at 10 mL/h in a 3 kg infant is calculated as follows: 10 × (1/100 mL) × (1000 mg/1 g) × (10 mL/h) × (1 h/60 min) × (1/3 kg) = 5.6 mg/kg/min\nAdditional calories are provided by phospholipid emulsifiers and glycerol.\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\n(PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium:Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride:Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr (PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium:Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride:Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr Parenteral nutrition therapy day # 10\nDosing weight: 0.87 kgs.

ILE provides 20% - 30% of total energy as ILE: 2400 kcal/d × 0.2 to 0.3 = 480 - 720 kcal/d. Because the PN admixture volume is restricted to 1.5 L/d, provide 30% of energy or 720 kcal/d with ILE 30%, which is more energy dense (3 kcal/mL) than dextrose 70% (2.38 kcal/mL). ILE 30% provides 3 kcal/mL; therefore, 720 kcal/d ÷ 3 kcal/mL = 240 mL. Dextrose: energy needed from dextrose = 2400 kcal - 480 kcal from amino acids - 720 kcal from ILE = 1200 kcal/d. 1200 kcal ÷ 3.4 kcal/g = 353 g dextrose.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\npreterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n ### Calcium and phosphorus The provision of adequate calcium and phosphorus in an optimal ratio is important for bone mineralization in neonates and infants, particularly those born preterm since maximum calcium and phosphorus accretion rates occur over the last 6 weeks of gestation. While solubility limits within PN solutions prohibit the supply of minerals provided in utero during the last trimester (6–7.5 mEq/kg/d calcium and 2.3–2.7 mmol/kg/d phosphorus), providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of 1.7 mg calcium to 1 mg phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary TABLE 33-4.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively.

Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n ### Calcium and phosphorus The provision of adequate calcium and phosphorus in an optimal ratio is important for bone mineralization in neonates and infants, particularly those born preterm since maximum calcium and phosphorus accretion rates occur over the last 6 weeks of gestation. While solubility limits within PN solutions prohibit the supply of minerals provided in utero during the last trimester (6–7.5 mEq/kg/d calcium and 2.3–2.7 mmol/kg/d phosphorus), providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of 1.7 mg calcium to 1 mg phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary TABLE 33-4.

Amylose is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple glucose units.\n2. The correct answer is C. The breakdown of sugars, especially lactose, lipids, and proteins is required to nourish the infant. Amylases would be used to break down complex starches; human milk does have HMOs and complex carbohydrates, but these are not digested by humans and are not necessary for infant nutrition.\n3. The correct answer is B. It is hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose.\n4. The correct answer is B. Lactase activity at the start of the third trimester is &lt;25% of that at term.\n5. The correct answer is D. Low amylase activity could result in the malabsorption of the rice cereal, which is a starch, with a resultant increase in osmotic drag from the poorly absorbed carbohydrate and the passage of the malabsorbed carbohydrate into the colon where it is fermented to SCFAs.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 57 -->\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ntrimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> process, also known as primary lactase deficiency or primary hypolactasia, commonly begins between 3 and 5 years of age and continues into adulthood.18 The prevalence of hypolactasia varies across ethnic populations as follows: 90% Asian, 80% Black, 53% Hispanic, and 15% to 25% non-Hispanic White.18 The role of variable digestive capacity for lactose in the development of illness among neonates is of uncertain significance. Studies conducted in preterm pigs suggest that incomplete digestion of carbohydrates may be linked to the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis.19 Additionally, the time until full feeding tolerance is inversely related to lactase activity (see Figure 3-3).16,20\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nhigh throughout life. Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency is a relatively rare (1/5000) autosomal recessive disorder in which patients lack sucrase and have variable isomaltase activity.15 ## Lactose Lactase is the enzyme responsible for digesting lactose, which is the primary carbohydrate in human milk and most infant formulas. Lactase hydrolyzes the disaccharide lactose into monosaccharides glucose and galactose (see Figure 3-2).3,5 Like maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, lactase is located along the brush border of the enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. Because the optimum pH for lactase activity is 6.0, its activity is highest in the jejunum and decreases toward the ileum.12 This gradient is established by 11 weeks of gestation.10 During gestation, lactase activity increases until birth, with the greatest increase occurring during the third trimester. At the beginning of the third trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 -->\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"8f48924cab2662b6c3a10025d829abe87268f0f05395d1d6485efb6deabc248d","retrieval_snapshot_id":"a14cf7758f454e08b75da8d028d09503","latency_ms":156.1417579650879,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7284094766546887,"rag_context_chars":5864,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Amylose is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple glucose units.\n2. The correct answer is C. The breakdown of sugars, especially lactose, lipids, and proteins is required to nourish the infant. Amylases would be used to break down complex starches; human milk does have HMOs and complex carbohydrates, but these are not digested by humans and are not necessary for infant nutrition.\n3. The correct answer is B. It is hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose.\n4. The correct answer is B. Lactase activity at the start of the third trimester is &lt;25% of that at term.\n5. The correct answer is D. Low amylase activity could result in the malabsorption of the rice cereal, which is a starch, with a resultant increase in osmotic drag from the poorly absorbed carbohydrate and the passage of the malabsorbed carbohydrate into the colon where it is fermented to SCFAs.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 57 -->\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ntrimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 --> process, also known as primary lactase deficiency or primary hypolactasia, commonly begins between 3 and 5 years of age and continues into adulthood.18 The prevalence of hypolactasia varies across ethnic populations as follows: 90% Asian, 80% Black, 53% Hispanic, and 15% to 25% non-Hispanic White.18 The role of variable digestive capacity for lactose in the development of illness among neonates is of uncertain significance.

In the United States, Intralipid is the primary commercial product used to provide lipids to neonates. This is a soybean-based oil with a high amount of omega-6 fatty acids (eg, linoleic acid) and phytosterols; this latter component is associated with cholestasis.¹ Other potential lipid emulsions being explored for commercial use contain fish oil, which has a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids (eg, docosahexaenoic acid) that may minimize the risk of liver disease.² A prolonged period of lipid infusion (&gt;2 weeks) can increase the risk of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.³ If a neonate who is receiving a lipid solution develops cholestasis, the lipid solution should be decreased, while protein and/or glucose supplementation should be increased to avoid caloric deprivation.⁴\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nless than 1250 g.

Multiple studies have shown that postnatal nutritional strategies for preterm neonates are unable to achieve the intrauterine accretion rates of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).¹,² The soybean-based Intralipid emulsion contains high amounts of linoleic acid (LA) but smaller amounts of LCPUFAs. When this lipid solution is administered in preterm neonates in the first week after birth, neonates' levels of LA increase with a decrease in DHA¹; these disturbances persist for more than 1 month despite enteral interventions. Even if DHA is administered enterally, preterm neonates have absorption rates of 70% to 80% and inefficient ability for hydrolysis of lipids.³\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

In the United States, Intralipid is the primary commercial product used to provide lipids to neonates. This is a soybean-based oil with a high amount of omega-6 fatty acids (eg, linoleic acid) and phytosterols; this latter component is associated with cholestasis.¹ Other potential lipid emulsions being explored for commercial use contain fish oil, which has a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids (eg, docosahexaenoic acid) that may minimize the risk of liver disease.² A prolonged period of lipid infusion (&gt;2 weeks) can increase the risk of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.³ If a neonate who is receiving a lipid solution develops cholestasis, the lipid solution should be decreased, while protein and/or glucose supplementation should be increased to avoid caloric deprivation.⁴\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nless than 1250 g.

Figure 1-1 illustrates the typical swallow sequencing in a bottle-feeding infant. ## Feeding Skills in the First Year The typical newborn is ready to feed shortly after birth . The reflexive root allows the infant to open the mouth, turn toward the food source, latch, and begin to suckle . The newborn will suckle, swallow, and breathe in a rhythmic sequence . This pattern is established through early reflexes that develop in utero, and the efficiency of this pattern improves by the third day of life.23 The rooting reflex is among the most important and is activated by a light touch on or near the infant's mouth . Once latched onto the nipple, the infant's tongue and jaw work together to express milk.24 The infant will feed in a burst-pause pattern that is usually quite regular, with the bursts being suck-swallow-and-breathe cycles and the pauses being brief and regular rest periods . Bursts of 8 sucks or more are seen in the typical newborn.25 Sensing changes in the nipple, the infant can vary the sucking pressure quite easily to control the flow of milk\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nacids are important for the development and function of the nervous system.

Manganese\nManganese is a trace element provided in neonatal parenteral nutrition. This compound activates specific enzymes (eg, superoxide dismutase), plays a role in bone structure, and assists with carbohydrate metabolism. A neonate who is deficient in manganese can develop dermatitis, hair depigmentation, growth failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive amounts can lead to basal ganglia injury as a result of manganese deposition.¹ Other trace elements have also been associated with toxicities,¹,² including the following:\n- Chromium (chronic renal failure)\n- Copper (cirrhosis of the liver)\n- Molybdenum (disruption of copper metabolism)\n- Zinc (decreased leukocyte and phagocyte activity) Excessive selenium has not been associated with toxicity.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nSridhar S, Arguello S, Lee HC.

Cysteine\nCysteine is required for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, helps to maintain redox potential, and assists with calcium homeostasis. In newborns, cysteine is a semiessential amino acid because of impaired cysteine production.¹ As a result, cysteine is routinely added to amino acid preparations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of its poor solubility, cysteine is often added last to the amino acid solution. References\n1.  Van Goudoever JB, Sulkers EJ, Timmerman M, et al.

Concerns regarding the hazards of ultraviolet radiation exposure have led to revised recommendations for sunlight exposure.60 Consequently, ensuring adequate vitamin D status, especially in the presence of factors that affect its endogenous synthesis, requires attention to dietary vitamin D supplementation.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"80a7e272b93fff1239b39c0ae52ace31b305600e8bbc7c3c67a92096f961a6e4","retrieval_snapshot_id":"c7040128cb13452f82e4cc7d88141dba","latency_ms":154.6304225921631,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7253920406759842,"rag_context_chars":5582,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

The primary form of riboflavin is an integral component of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), the predominant flavoenzyme in body tissues. These coenzymes are involved in multiple oxidation-reduction reactions integral to carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism and are involved in the metabolism of folate, pyridoxine, and niacin. Riboflavin-binding proteins expressed in fetuses of different species are essential to normal fetal development.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"da53362d11267a6bc2e6611f9ffdcdad37d080282b6fb2b1833048ede7879131","retrieval_snapshot_id":"7e4afa7ffd45457285d20417caeed179","latency_ms":159.97028350830078,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7288057147424292,"rag_context_chars":5859,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Polyglutamates are the forms retained in various tissues or found in blood or bile and are the forms needed for function as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfer reactions. Folate catabolism involves the cleavage of intracellular and circulatory polyglutamates to the monoglutamate form. Approximately two-thirds of the folate in plasma is protein-bound, and albumin accounts for approximately 50% of the bound folate. Folates filter freely through the glomeruli and are secreted and reabsorbed by the renal tubules. The bulk of the urine excretory products are folate cleavage products, mainly in the monoglutamate form. Extensive enterohepatic circulation of folate occurs.84 The estimated total body folate content is between 12 and 28 mg, of which approximately 50% is in the liver.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nto all enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meal, pasta products, rice, and other cereal grain products sold in the United States.

Biofortification of food during fermentation is also possible.61\n ### Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion Dietary folate equivalent has approximately 50% lower bioavailability compared with folic acid supplement. Food folates (polyglutamate derivatives) are hydrolyzed by conjugase enzymes to monoglutamate forms and then enter various cells by membrane carrier or folate-binding protein-mediated system. The folate --- <!-- Page 119 --> transporter derives from the SLC19 gene family of solute carriers and shares structural homology with the thiamin transporter.43,83 Monoglutamates, mainly 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, are metabolized in the liver and other tissues to polyglutamate derivatives by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase.

The use of thiamin in the treatment of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Freidrich's ataxia, and multiple sclerosis remains ill-defined. ## Riboflavin (Vitamin B_{2})\n ### Biochemistry and Physiology\n\nRiboflavin (7, 8-dimethyl-10-ribityl-isoalloxazine) is a water-soluble, yellow, fluorescent compound. The primary form of riboflavin is an integral component of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), the predominant flavoenzyme in body tissues. These coenzymes are involved in multiple oxidation-reduction reactions integral to carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism and are involved in the metabolism of folate, pyridoxine, and niacin. Riboflavin-binding proteins expressed in fetuses of different species are essential to normal fetal development.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"da53362d11267a6bc2e6611f9ffdcdad37d080282b6fb2b1833048ede7879131","retrieval_snapshot_id":"7e4afa7ffd45457285d20417caeed179","latency_ms":159.09457206726074,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7288057147424292,"rag_context_chars":5859,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Skin immaturity, radiant warmers, and phototherapy often increase insensible losses by as much as 20–40 mL/kg. Insensible losses are high during the first few weeks of life. Up to 200 mL/kg/d of fluid may be needed to maintain normal fluid balance in the preterm neonate.

Careful attention to fluid and salt balance is important to help reduce the risk of pulmonary edema. 1. Fluid and heat losses in the very immature infant (<26 wks gestation) during the first few days after birth can be minimized by keeping the infant in a warm, humidified chamber beneath a radiant warmer.\n2. Fluid balance can be monitored effectively by keeping the infant on a bed scale and measuring body weight at frequent intervals, and by keeping accurate records of fluid intake and urine output.\n3. Frequent measurements of serum electrolytes (every 6 hrs for the very immature infant, every 12 hrs for the infant >26 wks gestation) are important in helping to guide fluid therapy. Sodium is withheld from IV fluids for at least the first 24 hrs and is not added until there is an appropriate diuresis (>2 mL/kg/h) and the weight is at least 5% below birthweight.\n4. In a suitably humidified environment, appropriate initial rates of IV fluid intake for the premature infant are:\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"2c26533b9328ee47208a47c39bd1119bb29bb4c5f936cb4aa02f539f5dd4c61c","retrieval_snapshot_id":"004974cd876845c3b7464b9815bb64a3","latency_ms":162.45031356811523,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7263050544756517,"rag_context_chars":5404,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Energy needs can vary significantly over the first days and weeks and should be assessed regularly. A variety of factors may influence the energy expenditure of a hospitalized term or preterm infant14: - Physical activity\n- Dietary intake\n- Environmental interactions\n- Clinical conditions\n- Medications\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nare not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants.16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements. are not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants.16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements. are not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants.16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements. Parenterally fed infants typically require less energy than enterally fed infants, as the energy cost of digestion and absorption is lower with intravenous nutrient delivery, and there are reduced fecal energy losses.14 An additional 30 kcal/kg/d is required for enterally fed neonates to account for these differences.13 Parenteral and enteral energy requirements for term and preterm infants are listed in Tables 7-7 and 7-8. Some infants will require energy intakes greater than the amounts listed to achieve adequate growth. --- <!-- Page 218 --> TABLE 7-7.

Because preterm infants' suck-swallow-breathe coordination does not mature until 32 to 34 weeks of gestational age, they are dependent on tube feedings for up to 12 weeks.73 During this time of tube-feeding dependence, mothers must express their milk every 3 to 4 hours daily to provide adequate volume to feed their infant.61 Maintaining lactation during the often lengthy NICU stay is challenging for many mothers. Mother-infant separation, maternal illness that necessitated preterm delivery, family dynamics, lack of access to appropriate lactation counseling and support, socioeconomic status, transportation, and other factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nfactors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 Preterm MOM is preferred over other milk sources because of its unique nutrient density and bioactivity . It is imperative that mothers receive timely, appropriate, and continued lactation support and education throughout the NICU stay . Mothers who begin milk expression soon after delivery, preferably within 4 hours, will experience earlier lactogenesis and will sustain lactation longer.21 Immediate separation of mother and infant may compromise lactogenesis, but separation is often a medical necessity for preterm infants and mothers . In the preterm MOM-baby dyad, immediate lactation support to advance lactogenesis holds particular importance and requires collaboration from the labor and delivery staff and the NICU staff.31 Mothers require education on milk expression, access to hospital-grade electric breast pumps/supplies, and guidance on the safe handling and storage of expressed milk\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"b7e4e2acf484d1413aabbdb6318fa494423fda8ebf4aea75843da4cdd22587f0","retrieval_snapshot_id":"7a0d3f88da7840edb906aa2239804146","latency_ms":167.20914840698242,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7309533877450314,"rag_context_chars":5209,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Which of the following statements regarding feeding choices for this preterm neonate is correct? A. Donor human milk has consistently been associated with faster growth than has any other feeding alternative.\nB. Donor human milk has reduced the rates of necrotizing enterocolitis to 0 in most randomized clinical trials for neonates younger than 29-weeks' gestational age.\nC. The American Academy of Pediatrics supports the use of pasteurized donor human milk as a safe alternative if mother's own milk is not available.\nD. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pasteurized donor human milk should not be administered until preterm neonates have reached at least 34-weeks' postmenstrual age.\nE. The optimal first feeding choice in the week after delivery for this neonate is pasteurized donor human milk pooled from multiple donors.\n\n---\n[Source: Averys_Neonatology_Nutrition_and_Renal.md]\nincluding vision, mental scales (particularly cognition), motor scales, behavior, and hearing. - Preterm infants breastfed at discharge have less subnormal neurodevelopment at 2–5 years. including vision, mental scales (particularly cognition), motor scales, behavior, and hearing. - Preterm infants breastfed at discharge have less subnormal neurodevelopment at 2–5 years. including vision, mental scales (particularly cognition), motor scales, behavior, and hearing. - Preterm infants breastfed at discharge have less subnormal neurodevelopment at 2–5 years. including vision, mental scales (particularly cognition), motor scales, behavior, and hearing. - Preterm infants breastfed at discharge have less subnormal neurodevelopment at 2–5 years. - These effects last into infancy, childhood, and adolescence.\n- There are psychological benefits to a mother who provides her own milk to her infant. &gt; \"Human milk is the recommended basis of nutrition for the preterm infant: all preterm infants should receive human milk; human milk should be fortified with protein, minerals, and vitamins to ensure optimal nutrient intake for infants weighing &lt;1500 g at birth; and pasteurized donor human milk, appropriately fortified, should be used if mother's own milk is unavailable or its use is contraindicated.\" AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS (AAP)\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nfeeding of the preterm infant.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all breastfed or partially breastfed neonates receive 400 IU of vitamin D daily.\n\nMost preterm neonates have increased alkaline phosphatase levels (400–600 IU/L) at the time of discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all neonates who are receiving breast milk, regardless of birth gestational age, be supplemented with 400 IU of vitamin D.¹\n\nPediatric care providers should monitor the growth of former preterm neonates. As with term neonates, use of human milk is preferred. However, breastfeeding may need to be limited because additional calories added to pumped breast milk may be necessary to improve growth. Some former preterm neonates require hydrolyzed formula, and most of these neonates can transition to term formula at age 12 to 24 months.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"3d458d3b528fa412f08c158ff295ebdd925fc742849e5ee4d19dd3ae8272d5aa","retrieval_snapshot_id":"85df5928988a40068ca33acba9245ce3","latency_ms":158.23101997375488,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7293441704989457,"rag_context_chars":5386,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? approach the mother to discuss feeding type, and she indicates that she plans to provide infant formula only. Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? A. Because there are several biologically plausible mechanisms for human milk's role in the prevention of NEC, such as antigen-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins, as well as multiple observational studies demonstrating a protective effect compared with the effects of infant formula, mother's own milk is the preferred feeding choice for this neonate. B. Donor milk and mother's own milk have the same composition of bioactive factors and have equivalent protective effect on NEC; therefore, this mother should not be encouraged to pump during the hospitalization if donor milk is available.

Trace elements commonly added to PN solutions include zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and chromium . For term infants requiring short (ie, &lt;2 weeks) courses of PN, it may not be necessary to provide them, but they should be provided to preterm neonates upon PN initiation . In particular, zinc and copper are necessary for growth, and serious complications have been reported when they have not been provided . Table 7-17 provides the typical doses of the most commonly supplemented trace elements . Because of biliary excretion of copper and manganese, these trace elements should be reduced in patients with cholestasis .

DHM has less abundant HMOs compared to mother's own milk (MOM).48\n ## Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and the Milk Fat Globule Membrane Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are biologically pertinent fatty acids from the essential fatty acid omega-3 precursor linolenic acid-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the essential fatty acid omega 6 fatty acid linoleic acid-arachidonic acid (ARA) respectively providing impacts on cognitive development.49 Maternal concentrations are very dependent on diet, and genetic guidance affects the amount of transfer to the baby through human milk.50 Recent imaging of infants with increased LCPUFA illustrated enhanced myelin in critical areas of the brain during development.51 For these reasons, it is important for the nutrition support team to also counsel mothers on the impact of dietary intake.52\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n. Higher amounts of DHA are safe, and human milk contains a wide range of DHA; however, research does not conclusively support the benefits of the higher level of DHA found in European formulas.35,39 ## Functional Ingredients in Infant Formulas\n ### DHA and ARA\n\nLong-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) have been shown to play an important role in the neuro-development of infants. DHA and ARA are the most abundant LCPUFAs in the brain; DHA is also found in retinal cells.41--43 DHA and ARA can be obtained from dietary sources or by the endogenous conversion of their precursors, α-linolenic acid (18:3 ω3) and linoleic acid (18:2 ω6).42,43 DHA and ARA occur naturally in human milk, with levels varying based on maternal diet.\n\nDuring pregnancy, DHA and ARA are transported across the placenta to the fetus. Fetuses can synthesize DHA and ARA after 26 weeks of gestation, though the amount produced is highly variable.43 After birth, DHA and ARA are provided via human milk or infant formula supplemented with DHA and/or ARA. Infants fed formula without supplementation have been shown to have lower levels of DHA in the brain.43\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"bb5e4af09b408cceb3c0256d5de9db80af813bae458417d5928ebd74aa643901","retrieval_snapshot_id":"4674a89c492d4256a02a21b490dd1366","latency_ms":152.74310111999512,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7308508089311441,"rag_context_chars":5580,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

DHA and ARA are the most abundant LCPUFAs in the brain; DHA is also found in retinal cells.41--43 DHA and ARA can be obtained from dietary sources or by the endogenous conversion of their precursors, α-linolenic acid (18:3 ω3) and linoleic acid (18:2 ω6).42,43 DHA and ARA occur naturally in human milk, with levels varying based on maternal diet.\n\nDuring pregnancy, DHA and ARA are transported across the placenta to the fetus. Fetuses can synthesize DHA and ARA after 26 weeks of gestation, though the amount produced is highly variable.43 After birth, DHA and ARA are provided via human milk or infant formula supplemented with DHA and/or ARA. Infants fed formula without supplementation have been shown to have lower levels of DHA in the brain.43\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"bb5e4af09b408cceb3c0256d5de9db80af813bae458417d5928ebd74aa643901","retrieval_snapshot_id":"4674a89c492d4256a02a21b490dd1366","latency_ms":158.30039978027344,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7308508089311441,"rag_context_chars":5580,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Lysozyme is an acid-stable enzyme that has 300 times the concentration in human milk compared with cow's milk. Lysozyme is protective against gram-positive bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae.45 In addition to lactoferrin, sIgA, and lysozymes, many other bioactives in human milk act as anti-inflammatory agents and impart immunological benefits. These immune health benefits are especially important for immunocompromised, hospitalized infants.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nosteopenia status.

Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease. Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease because of the rapid response of the calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands. Preterm neonates with a chronic depletion of calcium, which can occur via medications such as glucocorticoids, diuretics, and methylxanthines, may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. These patients also have hypophosphatemia but a low tubular reabsorption of phosphate. Serum calcium is not a sensitive marker in screening for metabolic bone disease of prematurity. 43. A.

Neonates who receive prolonged courses of parenteral nutrition are at risk for developing liver injury and cholestasis.¹ Enteral feedings stimulate bile flow, gallbladder contraction, and intestinal motility. Even trophic feedings can be beneficial in reducing the degree of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. If parenteral nutrition is continued in the presence of cholestasis, manganese and copper should be reduced and plasma levels monitored because these metals can accumulate to toxic levels in the cholestatic liver.

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown. However, this increase is transient, and treated neonates have similar calcium levels 24 hours after treatment compared with levels in untreated control neonates. Treatment can also blunt the increase in parathyroid hormone concentration that occurs on the first day after birth. The use of total parenteral nutrition with a higher calcium concentration during this period is impractical because calcium phosphate crystals can precipitate in the catheters.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\n24 hours after treatment than do untreated control neonates.

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown.

The mother has expressed a small amount of colostrum and breast milk. Which of the following is an appropriate aspect of nutrition management for this neonate? A. Because parenteral nutrition provides adequate nutrition at this stage during the first week after delivery, enteral feedings should be withheld until 4 to 6 days after delivery to avoid increasing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nB. During the course of hospitalization for this preterm neonate, neonate formula should be used only in cases when the mother has HIV or hepatitis infection.\nC.

Thus, the current diet provided to these infants appears to be deficient in DHA. Preterm infants fed increased amounts of DHA have improved visual acuity and mental development.13,14 A multicenter prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in Italy compared 580 healthy term neonates receiving 20 mg of liquid DHA to 580 healthy term infants receiving a placebo with a focus on developmental milestones.15 The infants receiving DHA were able to sit without support 1 week earlier than the placebo group, but there was no difference in crawling, standing, or walking without assistance. It is unclear how these data from healthy term neonates relate to preterm neonates. For parenterally fed infants, the challenge to provide adequate DHA and ARA is even greater with the currently available intravenous lipid emulsions approved for use in this population.16\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nrequires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 requires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 Fatty acids and eicosanoids can also change the abundance of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression. Regulation of gene expression by nutrients is critically important in preterm neonates. Regulation of gene expression by ω-3 fatty acids involves multiple complex processes including regulation of the transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors that modulate many critical steps in metabolism.8,9 The 2 most abundant long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the brain are DHA and ARA. DHA is concentrated in the prefrontal cortex and some retinal cells.10 Inadequate intake of ω-3 fatty acids not only results in decreased brain DHA but also increased brain --- <!-- Page 61 -->\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"005e05ff08e7e978526fd79c01fca3c010af57f6fe787b98fa8203d5de8aff30","retrieval_snapshot_id":"3e1a9ad60c4646ec9734770235cde542","latency_ms":155.84230422973633,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7298530206909809,"rag_context_chars":4980,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Lysozyme is an acid-stable enzyme that has 300 times the concentration in human milk compared with cow's milk. Lysozyme is protective against gram-positive bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae.45 In addition to lactoferrin, sIgA, and lysozymes, many other bioactives in human milk act as anti-inflammatory agents and impart immunological benefits. These immune health benefits are especially important for immunocompromised, hospitalized infants.\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part6.md]\nbe unable to achieve this increase. E.

Abnormal bacterial proliferation is considered a likely factor in the development of NEC, especially in light of the presence of epidemic forms of the disease. F . Feeding, and its relationship to NEC, remain important areas of discussion . Since 90-95% of all infants who develop NEC have been fed, feeding is thought to play a role in NEC . However, the great majority of premature infants who are fed do not develop NEC . **The use of breast milk, and clear and consistent feeding algorithms are recommended as ways to reduce the incidence of NEC.** Lactoferrin, a normal component of human colostrum and milk, can enhance host defense and may be effective in the prevention of sepsis and NEC in preterm neonates . Implementation of a standardized feeding protocol utilizing human breast milk has been shown to be associated with a reduction of NEC and other morbidities in several studies and from several NICUs, including LPCH . Since growth and development is of extreme importance in the premature infant, initiation of feedings with breast milk should be considered at the earliest period feasible .

Pacifier sucking differs from sucking for nutritional intake. In pacifier sucking (nonnutritive sucking), the suck rate is twice as fast as nutritive sucking.25 The infant only has to balance breathing and swallowing until a critical volume of saliva has been collected that will trigger a pharyngeal swallow response. Therefore, infants participating in nonnutritive sucking swallow with significantly less frequency as compared to swallowing frequency during nutritive sucking. This also means that infants sucking on a pacifier do not have to tolerate a swallow apnea with every suck, thus explaining why many nonfeeding infants can non-nutritively suck but have difficulty when a nipple introduces liquid.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nto suck, swallow, and breathe in a coordinated manner is a developmental process.

Pacifier sucking differs from sucking for nutritional intake. In pacifier sucking (nonnutritive sucking), the suck rate is twice as fast as nutritive sucking.25 The infant only has to balance breathing and swallowing until a critical volume of saliva has been collected that will trigger a pharyngeal swallow response. Therefore, infants participating in nonnutritive sucking swallow with significantly less frequency as compared to swallowing frequency during nutritive sucking. This also means that infants sucking on a pacifier do not have to tolerate a swallow apnea with every suck, thus explaining why many nonfeeding infants can non-nutritively suck but have difficulty when a nipple introduces liquid.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nto suck, swallow, and breathe in a coordinated manner is a developmental process.

Manganese\nManganese is a trace element provided in neonatal parenteral nutrition. This compound activates specific enzymes (eg, superoxide dismutase), plays a role in bone structure, and assists with carbohydrate metabolism. A neonate who is deficient in manganese can develop dermatitis, hair depigmentation, growth failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive amounts can lead to basal ganglia injury as a result of manganese deposition.¹ Other trace elements have also been associated with toxicities,¹,² including the following:\n- Chromium (chronic renal failure)\n- Copper (cirrhosis of the liver)\n- Molybdenum (disruption of copper metabolism)\n- Zinc (decreased leukocyte and phagocyte activity) Excessive selenium has not been associated with toxicity.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\n0.01 mg ergocalciferol = 400 USP units.\nc 7 mg vitamin E = 7 USP units.

It should be noted that the commercially available multiple trace element combinations in the United States contain 3–5 times the recommended dosages for manganese and may contribute to complications in long-term patients. See Table 4-6 for trace element supplementation for PN.²⁹⁻³¹ Other trace elements that may be supplemented in PN include molybdenum, iodine, and iron.²⁹ Three injectable iron products are available, all as single-entity products. Only iron dextran is approved for addition to PN admixtures, but this should only be considered for dextrose/amino acid (2-in-1) formulations because ILEs are disrupted by iron.³⁰ Table 4-6.

Trace elements commonly added to PN solutions include zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and chromium . For term infants requiring short (ie, &lt;2 weeks) courses of PN, it may not be necessary to provide them, but they should be provided to preterm neonates upon PN initiation . In particular, zinc and copper are necessary for growth, and serious complications have been reported when they have not been provided . Table 7-17 provides the typical doses of the most commonly supplemented trace elements . Because of biliary excretion of copper and manganese, these trace elements should be reduced in patients with cholestasis .

Manganese\nManganese is a trace element provided in neonatal parenteral nutrition. This compound activates specific enzymes (eg, superoxide dismutase), plays a role in bone structure, and assists with carbohydrate metabolism. A neonate who is deficient in manganese can develop dermatitis, hair depigmentation, growth failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive amounts can lead to basal ganglia injury as a result of manganese deposition.¹ Other trace elements have also been associated with toxicities,¹,² including the following:\n- Chromium (chronic renal failure)\n- Copper (cirrhosis of the liver)\n- Molybdenum (disruption of copper metabolism)\n- Zinc (decreased leukocyte and phagocyte activity) Excessive selenium has not been associated with toxicity.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\n0.01 mg ergocalciferol = 400 USP units.\nc 7 mg vitamin E = 7 USP units.

Magnesium plays a critical role in the functioning of the Na^{+}-K^{+}-ATPase pump, thus affecting neuromuscular transmission, cardiovascular excitability, vasomotor tone, and muscle contraction. Magnesium is also an integral component of bone and parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Magnesium is found primarily in the ICF, with only about 2% of total body stores found in the ECF. More than 50% of the magnesium in the body resides in bone. About 61% of serum magnesium is physiologically active in the ionized form, 33% protein bound, and 5% complexed to phosphate, citrate, and other compounds.49,50\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\na protein-bound (~30%) and an ultrafiltrable (~70%) portion.

Magnesium plays a critical role in the functioning of the Na^{+}-K^{+}-ATPase pump, thus affecting neuromuscular transmission, cardiovascular excitability, vasomotor tone, and muscle contraction. Magnesium is also an integral component of bone and parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Magnesium is found primarily in the ICF, with only about 2% of total body stores found in the ECF. More than 50% of the magnesium in the body resides in bone. About 61% of serum magnesium is physiologically active in the ionized form, 33% protein bound, and 5% complexed to phosphate, citrate, and other compounds.49,50\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\na protein-bound (~30%) and an ultrafiltrable (~70%) portion.

It is critical for normal ATP function and glucose metabolism, and it is necessary for both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Mg is also important in cellular cytoskeleton contraction and at the myoneural junction; in this role, it can alter skeletal and cardiac muscle function. Among numerous other cell functions, Mg catalyzes enzymatic processes for the transfer, storage, and use of energy and regulates movement of potassium and Ca across cell membranes. Abnormalities in circulating Mg concentrations are associated with widespread cellular effects.1,59--62\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"e52f6a6cc99f470622341790098185305aa9c5cecf486f4b24fa0d817ce7f4d8","retrieval_snapshot_id":"7a25e93295ca4ce0ba67226de946ae16","latency_ms":159.17301177978516,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7267936661432862,"rag_context_chars":5451,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Some Ca compounds, such as calcium citrate, are better absorbed than calcium carbonate in individuals with decreased gastric acid. About 90% of the Ca absorbed is through the small intestine, and the large intestine can absorb the remainder.[23] Dietary Ca absorption, particularly in young children, is primarily regulated by Ca rather than vitamin D intake.[1,2,24-26] At high dietary Ca intake, paracellular absorption takes place throughout the small intestine and depends on the concentration gradient.

At low Ca intake, transcellular absorption takes place largely in the duodenum and is dependent on 1,25(OH)₂D.[27] The role of 1,25(OH)₂D in epithelial transport, including TABLE 6-2.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

Brain\n\nThe highest amount of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in humans is found in the brain and retina. In the brain cortex, the greatest concentration occurs in the synapses,¹ and in the retina, the highest amount is concentrated in the photoreceptor cells. Preterm neonates have lower amounts of LCPUFAs in the brain and retina because intrauterine acquisition is decreased.²\n\n### References\n\n1. Cotman C, Blank ML, Moehl A, Synder F.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

In human studies, casein-predominant formulas result in lower zinc bioavailability than whey-predominant formulas, presumably because of less casein digestion.22 Other types of human whey proteins include secretory IgA and lactoferrin.21 Secretory IgA attaches to the lining of the GI tract and prevents potential pathogenic microorganisms from adhering.9 Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that limits the ability of bacteria to thrive in the intestines. Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nUnited Kingdom: Cambridge University Press; 2006:281-283\n2.

Current pasteurization techniques lead to elimination of oligosaccharides, which may provide gastrointestinal protection to the neonate. donated milk compared with mother's own milk is correct? A. Current pasteurization techniques lead to elimination of oligosaccharides, which may provide gastrointestinal protection to the neonate. B. Donated human milk after pasteurization is essentially the same as current preterm formula in both biological and nutrient content. C. Donor milk has higher energy content after pasteurization than does raw milk. D. Pasteurization may reduce the amount and activity of lysozyme in donor milk compared with those in mother's own milk. E. Secretory immunoglobulin A remains at the same level of quantity and quality in donor milk, when pasteurized using current methods, as in mother's own milk. Source: Valentine CJ, Dumm M.

In human studies, casein-predominant formulas result in lower zinc bioavailability than whey-predominant formulas, presumably because of less casein digestion.22 Other types of human whey proteins include secretory IgA and lactoferrin.21 Secretory IgA attaches to the lining of the GI tract and prevents potential pathogenic microorganisms from adhering.9 Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that limits the ability of bacteria to thrive in the intestines. Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"391a9a2af6803bbb6c3e25861b38986f5e1ee1330543524e35ea57d246976289","retrieval_snapshot_id":"d183cfa7861e418caa6974d4ec9098ed","latency_ms":152.2042751312256,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7260845683672171,"rag_context_chars":5258,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Concentrations of lactoferrin decrease over time and settle at 180 mg/dL by 5 months of lactation.38 Lactoferrin is necessary for iron absorption from human milk and is affected by maternal protein-energy malnutrition.40 Mothers who are protein-energy malnourished but not iron-deficient are lactoferrin-deficient.15\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nof amino acids into circulation.

Therefore, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are required in the human diet and are termed \"essential fatty acids.\"1 The shortest chain ω-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid (LA). Humans can convert LA to arachidonic acid (ARA). The shortest chain ω-3 fatty acid is α-linolenic acid (αLA). Humans can convert αLA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and convert EPA very slowly to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The same enzyme pool is used to metabolize LA and αLA to their respective longer-chain metabolites. The more prevalent fatty acid is preferentially metabolized. Thus, with a diet high in the ω-6 fatty acid LA, LA will be preferentially metabolized over the ω-3 fatty acid αLA. ARA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-6) and EPA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-3) are released from membranes and further metabolized to a cascade of eicosanoids. Although it is not quite so simple, eicosanoids from ω-6 fatty acids are generally considered proinflammatory and those from ω-3 fatty acids are considered weakly anti-inflammatory. The docosanoid products of DHA also have anti-inflammatory actions.3\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nrequires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 requires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 Fatty acids and eicosanoids can also change the abundance of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression. Regulation of gene expression by nutrients is critically important in preterm neonates. Regulation of gene expression by ω-3 fatty acids involves multiple complex processes including regulation of the transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors that modulate many critical steps in metabolism.8,9 The 2 most abundant long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the brain are DHA and ARA.

Therefore, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are required in the human diet and are termed \"essential fatty acids.\"1 The shortest chain ω-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid (LA). Humans can convert LA to arachidonic acid (ARA). The shortest chain ω-3 fatty acid is α-linolenic acid (αLA). Humans can convert αLA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and convert EPA very slowly to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The same enzyme pool is used to metabolize LA and αLA to their respective longer-chain metabolites. The more prevalent fatty acid is preferentially metabolized. Thus, with a diet high in the ω-6 fatty acid LA, LA will be preferentially metabolized over the ω-3 fatty acid αLA. ARA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-6) and EPA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-3) are released from membranes and further metabolized to a cascade of eicosanoids.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nand on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ and on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ # References 1.

Perianal dermatitis\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nmeet daily requirements.\nᵃContents per 1 mL: zinc, 1000 μg; copper, 60 μg; manganese, 3 μg; and selenium, 6 μg (accurate at the time of publication; check with manufacturer for current information). ## Zinc\n\nZinc is an essential trace element necessary for metabolism of energy and growth. Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nand on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ and on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ # References 1.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all neonates, including those born preterm, receive human milk feedings. However, certain maternal demographic characteristics are potential obstacles for human milk use, especially in preterm neonates. Of the following, the maternal demographic characteristic most likely to present an obstacle to human milk feeding in preterm neonates is:\nA. High school education\nB. Language barrier\nC.

Low income In the United States, women who are African American and have a low income are more likely to deliver a very low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonate. This group is also less likely to initiate breastfeeding. This has implications in studies that are examining the benefit of breast milk for VLBW neonates because low-income families may be underrepresented. --- <!-- Page 387 --> Fluids, Electrolytes, Nutrition\n379\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nImmunoglobulin A and G levels are decreased slightly.

Significantly improved folate status, indicated by population survey of red cell and serum folate, has been reported since the mandate for folic acid fortification of selected foods. ### Supplementation\n\nTaking folate supplements in the preconception period and during pregnancy (for the prevention of neural tube defects) is an established practice.40 Excessive folate intake may precipitate or exacerbate neuropathy in individuals with vitamin B_{12} deficiency. Folate supplementation has been implicated in delayed diagnosis of pernicious anemia until after irreversible neurological damage has occurred.83,86 These risks are increased in cases of reduced hepatic transformation of folic acid (eg, caused by genetic variants or during some pharmacotherapies). 5-MTHF may be a better alternative to folic acid supplementation because it is immediately available as a methyl donor in many metabolic reactions. Additionally, it does not accumulate in blood\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 120 -->\n\nlike folic acid does in cases of reduced hepatic transformation. However, the use of 5-MTHF instead of folate supplement under various clinical conditions remains to be determined.86\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"b160c0880eba1ce9471fd09a711c1d66cbbc3fbfbf6ac3bb911b931e21d49c80","retrieval_snapshot_id":"4a3a8e67f03d4077b2631b16b6d82de2","latency_ms":156.92520141601562,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.6617688536884339,"rag_context_chars":5616,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Cysteine\nCysteine is required for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, helps to maintain redox potential, and assists with calcium homeostasis. In newborns, cysteine is a semiessential amino acid because of impaired cysteine production.¹ As a result, cysteine is routinely added to amino acid preparations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of its poor solubility, cysteine is often added last to the amino acid solution. References\n1.  Van Goudoever JB, Sulkers EJ, Timmerman M, et al.

Glutathione\n\nMultiple antioxidant systems, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic, have evolved to counteract oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important nonenzymatic intracellular antioxidant. GSH molecules form a disulfide bond to form oxidized GSH (GSSG) and in the process serve as electron donors, leading to reduction of disulfide bonds. Glutathione reductase then reduces GSSG back to GSH by using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor. Other nonenzymatic antioxidants include transferrin and ceruloplasmin, which can bind transition metals, as well as free radical quenchers, such as uric acid and bilirubin.\n\nEnzymatic pathways of defense against free radical injury include the superoxide dismutase family of antioxidant enzymes, catalases, GSH peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.¹ Newborns, particularly those born preterm, are at increased risk of oxidative stress because of an immature antioxidant system.¹,²\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ncholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 Selenium is critical for antioxidant capacity, primarily through glutathione peroxidase, for immune function, and as a cofactor for thyroid hormone production and regulation; needs may be increased with critical illness and thermal injury.55,63 Selenium deficiency may present as cardiomyopathy (ie, Keshan disease), myalgias, myositis, hemolysis, and impaired cellular immunity.55,63\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"","parsed_answer":null,"correct":null,"retrieval_context_hash":"05040f409f4506edb6b93cc363d08b4b81e148988c5ade47e7738abd0453e754","retrieval_snapshot_id":"0b9e33672fee4265a83e35c20b3b5b3f","latency_ms":157.50718116760254,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7301286716563767,"rag_context_chars":6018,"rag_returned_chunks":6},"structured_output_used":false,"error":"Failed to initialize google/medgemma-27b-text-it"}

Cue-based feeding\n\nThere are different interventions or feeding strategies that can be used when transitioning a preterm neonate from gastric to oral feedings.¹ If a neonate has clinical instability during feedings, interventions such as cue-based feedings, slow-flow nipples, and pacing may help to establish more stable feedings.
