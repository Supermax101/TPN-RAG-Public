Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W.

A neonate is born at 28 weeks' gestational age and has poor tone and respiratory effort after cesarean delivery for maternal indications, with maternal history of preeclampsia and fetal intolerance of labor. The Apgar score is 3 at 1 minute, 4 at 5 minutes, and 6 at 10 minutes. The newborn receives positive pressure ventilation and is intubated. The blood gas shows a metabolic and respiratory acidosis. What is the current status of evaluation and practice for preterm newborns and neonatal encephalopathy? A. Although the trials are still ongoing, due to the likelihood of benefit and low risk of harm, this patient should receive therapeutic hypothermia. B. An Apgar score of 7 or less at 5 minutes is highly predictive of moderate to severe cerebral palsy at 3-year follow-up.\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part4.md]\nappropriate diuresis (>2 mL/kg/h) and the weight is at least 5% below birthweight.\n4. In a suitably humidified environment, appropriate initial rates of IV fluid intake for the premature infant are: appropriate diuresis (>2 mL/kg/h) and the weight is at least 5% below birthweight.\n4. In a suitably humidified environment, appropriate initial rates of IV fluid intake for the premature infant are: >28 wks gestation: 60-80 mL/kg\n26-28 wks gestation: 80-100 mL/kg\n<26 wks gestation: 100-120 mL/kg 5. These guidelines assume close monitoring of body weight, intake/output measurements, and serum sodium as noted above. 6. After the brisk diuresis that usually occurs during the first 3-7 days, urine output generally decreases to about 2-4 mL/kg/h, and fluid intake can be adjusted to about 120-150 mL/kg/d. 7. Once on full enteral nutrition, infants without evidence of CHF or renal dysfunction can almost always tolerated greater intake volumes, e.g., 160-180 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part2.md]\nlevels in utero that result in pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia.

Therefore, they may be relatively hyperinsulinemic at birth, resulting in higher than normal glucose requirements and hypoglycemia. E. Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W. We may infuse concentrations between D3W and D12.5W through a peripheral IV. Higher concentrations require central access. F.

However, until an optimal multitrace element product is developed, one mechanism for dose-adjusting trace elements based on age-specific or disease-specific needs is to supplement PN solutions with copper, selenium, and zinc using the single-entity products instead of the multitrace element products. Thus, accumulation of chromium and manganese can be avoided. For institutions using multitrace element products, supplemental zinc may be required in certain patients, such as preterm infants and those with increased GI losses.

However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2.

If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Specially formulated amino acid blends may be extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease). To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth. Infants only provided dextrose-containing fluids would continue to break down muscle mass that is difficult to regain.

Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

This caution is emphasized in a recent ASPEN position paper.14 Often, nonprotein calories of 60 to 80 kcal/kg/d, perhaps even less, are sufficient to meet initial neonate goals.15 Documented studies indicate that preterm neonates often require a generous protein supply, perhaps as high as 4 g/kg/d, which primarily provides a substrate for tissue repair but does not independently prevent catabolism of the existing muscle mass. Counting this protein delivery as energy-yielding caloric intake may result in inadequate caloric provision; this is the basis for calculating and targeting nonprotein calories in the acute perioperative setting. To provide an optimal substrate for nutrient assimilation, a nonprotein calorie-to-nitrogen ratio of 130:1 to 210:1 is generally recommended as the target PN solution.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nwhich prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria.

Obtaining a capillary blood glucose concentration 30 minutes to 1 hour after the PN formulation is discontinued will help identify rebound hypoglycemia. ### Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency ILE is generally provided as a source of essential fatty acids and as a nonprotein energy source . Although the incidence is low, several potential complications are associated with ILE use, such as infusion-related adverse reactions and allergy to the ILE components . Depending on the length of the PN therapy and the nutrition status of the patient, ILE-free PN may result in essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) . Two polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and α-linolenic acid, cannot be synthesized by the body and are considered essential . Clinical manifestations of EFAD include scaly dermatitis, alopecia, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, fatty liver, and anemia.10 Biochemical evidence of EFAD is determined by a triene-to-tetraene ratio of >0.2 and can occur within 1--3 weeks in adults receiving ILE-free PN.11 The adult requirements for linoleic acid are met through exogenous sources or endogenously through the lipolysis of adipose tissue\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nAcid (EFA) Deficiency Monitoring: EFA deficiency may develop in 1-3 weeks on no/low exogenous EFA delivery.

For prolonged restriction or manifestation of symptoms: obtain EFA profiles, monitoring triene:tetraene ratio (&gt;0.4 diagnostic of EFA deficiency), LFTs, platelets.

Bone mineralization is improved in preterm infants given mineral-rich preterm and postdischarge formulas compared to standard term formulas. However, this may not persist into adulthood.205 Human milk with human milk fortifier is currently recommended for small preterm infants because it can preserve the beneficial nutrition and immunological effects of human milk while providing additional energy, protein, minerals, and other micronutrients. Preterm formula (vs term formula) is recommended for formula-fed preterm infants. However, there is no evidence indicating that postdischarge formulas improve developmental outcomes more than standard term formulas after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, in the smallest infants, postdischarge formulas have been observed to enhance head growth. Data from Ehrenkranz et al regarding the positive developmental outcome of encouraging early growth in preterm infants advise against any go-slow approach for these infants to possibly reduce markers of future cardiovascular risk (to values below those observed in healthy term infants).206\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nJ, Garcia AL, Mactier H, Edwards CA.

Extra-uterine growth restriction is an ongoing issue in the NICU. Neonates, particularly premature ones, whose nutritional needs are not met for a significant length of time, rapidly fall off their optimal growth curve. Even a short period without appropriate nutrition can result in protein, calcium, or phosphorus deficiencies that can be difficult to correct.

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: 9_AcidBaseDisorders.md]\nNUTRITION SUPPORT\nCERTIFICATE Upon admission to the hospital and continuation of PN, what change should be made based on RK's ABG? to multiple days of high volume emesis.\n- Laboratory values:\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nand the neonate will become catabolic and break down their protein stores for energy.

These include minimizing aluminum exposure, protecting the solutions from light, and avoidance of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate--containing materials.

Expression of human milk impacts nutrients such as fat, which can be variable based on milk expression timing; vitamin C, which is vulnerable to light exposure; and bioactive ingredients, which may be diminished during freezing.112,113 Healthcare facilities should prepare, store, and deliver human milk safely to protect and preserve the milk. Accurate track-and-trace systems must also be in place to prevent incorrect administration of human milk.113,114\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby mixing each feed with an HMF or preterm formula. Clinicians should include the family when planning prescriptions. For a parent-centered algorithm to use at discharge, see Figure 11-3. ## Term Infants Hospitalized term infants often have a diagnosis that impacts nutrient requirements, absorption, and delivery. As with preterm infants, hospitalized term infants are separated from their mothers and may undergo surgery and/or intubation, which may temporarily prevent direct breastfeeding. The provision of expressed MOM is important to protect these infants from common infections in immunocompromised infants. Human milk fortification is necessary for term infants who have fluid restrictions (<140 mL/kg/d);increased energy needs (with cardiac or pulmonary disorders); andexcess nutrient losses or poor absorption from diuretic use, ostomies (colostomy, jejunostomy, thoracostomy), dialysis, cystic fibrosis, hepatic, or renal failure.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nbe required to meet the nutritional needs of this vulnerable population.

Clinical decisions to adjust the enteral feeding regimen are determined by several factors, primarily stool or ostomy output, evidence of malabsorption, and other less objective symptoms such as abdominal fullness, irritability, and regurgitation. Currently, decisions related to advancing enteral feeding, weaning PN, and long-term monitoring of patients at risk for growth failure are based almost completely on experience, tradition, and art rather than evidence-based algorithms. However, institutions have created feeding protocols to standardize their own practice with excellent results at expediting PN-weaning and reducing IF-associated liver disease (IFALD) incidence.49 The understanding of the relative importance of these factors, how they are incorporated into daily management, and how they impact adaptation in patients with IF is critical if the management of infants with IF is to move beyond art and tradition and into an evidence-based practice of medicine.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nhas been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. has been limited, recent surveys have shown that this neonate would definitively be receiving probiotics during the initial hospitalization in any neonatal intensive care unit in the United Kingdom.

These issues are also discussed in Chapter 25, “Intestinal Failure.” As the infant enters the recovery phase without any infectious or wound-healing complications, the focus changes toward the more typical pediatric goals of nutrition support covering both acute needs and those for growth and development. At this point, documentation of weight gain, normalization of acute-phase reactants (eg, CRP), and establishment of increasing prealbumin values become the primary outcome measures. As mentioned previously, the focus on providing protein purely for wound-related anabolism is reduced at this point, and caloric provision should include protein-derived calories to avoid the complications of overfeeding.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nthere are disadvantages; there can be risk of high stoma output and salt and water loss.

Remember to wean the IL-20 as feedings advance, since fats make up most of the caloric content of milk. Once feedings of ≥ 80 mL/kg/d are achieved, the IL-20 rate should be restricted to 1 g/kg/day, and IL-20 may be stopped when feedings are ≥ 100-120 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\n: 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 : 0 %                   0 Kcal/kg\nProtein     : 21.3 %                7.2 Kcal/kg\nCarbohydrate: 78.7 %                26.6 Kcal/kg\nNon-protein Calories - GM Nitrogen Ratio (PN): 95:1 Enteral feeding: 11 ml Q 3 hrs of Full strength Breast Milk/MBM\n(0.68 cal/ml) provides 67.4 Kcal/kg and 101.1 ml/kg\nTotal Kcals (all sources): 101.2 Kcal/kg\nGlucose Infusion Rate (PN): 4.94 mg/kg/min\nCalcium: Phosphate Ratio (PN) 1.49:1 (mg:mg)\nChloride: Acetate Ratio (PN) 0.3:1\nHeparin infusion rate: 1.02 Units/kg/hr\nMax Potassium infusion rate: 0.02 mEq/kg/hr or 0.02 mEq/hr ethacin Patient Case: Day 9 to 10 TPN Ex-25w0d, birthweight 0.87 kg, RDS, PDA Parenteral nutrition therapy day # 9\nDosing weight: 0.87 kgs.

ILE 30% provides 3 kcal/mL; therefore, 720 kcal/d ÷ 3 kcal/mL = 240 mL.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\npreterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n ### Calcium and phosphorus The provision of adequate calcium and phosphorus in an optimal ratio is important for bone mineralization in neonates and infants, particularly those born preterm since maximum calcium and phosphorus accretion rates occur over the last 6 weeks of gestation. While solubility limits within PN solutions prohibit the supply of minerals provided in utero during the last trimester (6–7.5 mEq/kg/d calcium and 2.3–2.7 mmol/kg/d phosphorus), providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of 1.7 mg calcium to 1 mg phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary TABLE 33-4.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively.

Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n ### Calcium and phosphorus The provision of adequate calcium and phosphorus in an optimal ratio is important for bone mineralization in neonates and infants, particularly those born preterm since maximum calcium and phosphorus accretion rates occur over the last 6 weeks of gestation. While solubility limits within PN solutions prohibit the supply of minerals provided in utero during the last trimester (6–7.5 mEq/kg/d calcium and 2.3–2.7 mmol/kg/d phosphorus), providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of 1.7 mg calcium to 1 mg phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary TABLE 33-4.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency is a relatively rare (1/5000) autosomal recessive disorder in which patients lack sucrase and have variable isomaltase activity.15 ## Lactose Lactase is the enzyme responsible for digesting lactose, which is the primary carbohydrate in human milk and most infant formulas. Lactase hydrolyzes the disaccharide lactose into monosaccharides glucose and galactose (see Figure 3-2).3,5 Like maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, lactase is located along the brush border of the enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. Because the optimum pH for lactase activity is 6.0, its activity is highest in the jejunum and decreases toward the ileum.12 This gradient is established by 11 weeks of gestation.10 During gestation, lactase activity increases until birth, with the greatest increase occurring during the third trimester. At the beginning of the third trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 -->\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: According to the clinical knowledge base (Avery's Neonatology), lactase activity in infants less than 34 weeks' gestation is approximately 30% of normal term infant activity.

Amylose is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple glucose units.\n2. The correct answer is C. The breakdown of sugars, especially lactose, lipids, and proteins is required to nourish the infant. Amylases would be used to break down complex starches; human milk does have HMOs and complex carbohydrates, but these are not digested by humans and are not necessary for infant nutrition.\n3. The correct answer is B. It is hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose.\n4. The correct answer is B. Lactase activity at the start of the third trimester is &lt;25% of that at term.\n5.

In the United States, Intralipid is the primary commercial product used to provide lipids to neonates. This is a soybean-based oil with a high amount of omega-6 fatty acids (eg, linoleic acid) and phytosterols; this latter component is associated with cholestasis.¹ Other potential lipid emulsions being explored for commercial use contain fish oil, which has a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids (eg, docosahexaenoic acid) that may minimize the risk of liver disease.² A prolonged period of lipid infusion (&gt;2 weeks) can increase the risk of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.³ If a neonate who is receiving a lipid solution develops cholestasis, the lipid solution should be decreased, while protein and/or glucose supplementation should be increased to avoid caloric deprivation.⁴\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nless than 1250 g.

Multiple studies have shown that postnatal nutritional strategies for preterm neonates are unable to achieve the intrauterine accretion rates of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).¹,² The soybean-based Intralipid emulsion contains high amounts of linoleic acid (LA) but smaller amounts of LCPUFAs. When this lipid solution is administered in preterm neonates in the first week after birth, neonates' levels of LA increase with a decrease in DHA¹; these disturbances persist for more than 1 month despite enteral interventions. Even if DHA is administered enterally, preterm neonates have absorption rates of 70% to 80% and inefficient ability for hydrolysis of lipids.³\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

In the United States, Intralipid is the primary commercial product used to provide lipids to neonates. This is a soybean-based oil with a high amount of omega-6 fatty acids (eg, linoleic acid) and phytosterols; this latter component is associated with cholestasis.¹ Other potential lipid emulsions being explored for commercial use contain fish oil, which has a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids (eg, docosahexaenoic acid) that may minimize the risk of liver disease.² A prolonged period of lipid infusion (&gt;2 weeks) can increase the risk of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.³ If a neonate who is receiving a lipid solution develops cholestasis, the lipid solution should be decreased, while protein and/or glucose supplementation should be increased to avoid caloric deprivation.⁴\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nless than 1250 g.

Figure 1-1 illustrates the typical swallow sequencing in a bottle-feeding infant. ## Feeding Skills in the First Year The typical newborn is ready to feed shortly after birth . The reflexive root allows the infant to open the mouth, turn toward the food source, latch, and begin to suckle . The newborn will suckle, swallow, and breathe in a rhythmic sequence . This pattern is established through early reflexes that develop in utero, and the efficiency of this pattern improves by the third day of life.23 The rooting reflex is among the most important and is activated by a light touch on or near the infant's mouth . Once latched onto the nipple, the infant's tongue and jaw work together to express milk.24 The infant will feed in a burst-pause pattern that is usually quite regular, with the bursts being suck-swallow-and-breathe cycles and the pauses being brief and regular rest periods . Bursts of 8 sucks or more are seen in the typical newborn.25 Sensing changes in the nipple, the infant can vary the sucking pressure quite easily to control the flow of milk\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nacids are important for the development and function of the nervous system.

Cysteine\nCysteine is required for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, helps to maintain redox potential, and assists with calcium homeostasis. In newborns, cysteine is a semiessential amino acid because of impaired cysteine production.¹ As a result, cysteine is routinely added to amino acid preparations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of its poor solubility, cysteine is often added last to the amino acid solution. References\n1.  Van Goudoever JB, Sulkers EJ, Timmerman M, et al.

The ASPEN Novel Nutrient Task Force recommends routine carnitine supplementation of 2 to 5 mg/kg/d to neonatal PN if no enteral source was provided.47 ### Cysteine Cysteine has been considered a conditionally essential amino acid in neonates and infants because of the enzymatic immaturity of the transsulfuration pathway responsible for the conversion of methionine to cysteine and ultimately to taurine.73 Cysteine is not a component of crystalline amino acid solutions because it is unstable and will form an insoluble precipitate.21 Common dosing for L-cysteine hydrochloride is 30 to 40 mg/g of pediatric amino acids; however, 20 mg/g may be adequate.74 In general, current practice suggests supplementation with L-cysteine hydrochloride for the first year of life, although actual practice varies widely.20 Riedijk et al75 have suggested that cysteine requirements are satisfied in 1-month-old preterm infants born at 32 weeks of gestation or older who are on a full enteral diet\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n<!-- Page 84 --> Herrera and Helms of parenteral and enteral nutrition in adult and pediatric patients.

Polyglutamates are the forms retained in various tissues or found in blood or bile and are the forms needed for function as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfer reactions. Folate catabolism involves the cleavage of intracellular and circulatory polyglutamates to the monoglutamate form. Approximately two-thirds of the folate in plasma is protein-bound, and albumin accounts for approximately 50% of the bound folate. Folates filter freely through the glomeruli and are secreted and reabsorbed by the renal tubules. The bulk of the urine excretory products are folate cleavage products, mainly in the monoglutamate form. Extensive enterohepatic circulation of folate occurs.84 The estimated total body folate content is between 12 and 28 mg, of which approximately 50% is in the liver.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nto all enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meal, pasta products, rice, and other cereal grain products sold in the United States.

Food folates (polyglutamate derivatives) are hydrolyzed by conjugase enzymes to monoglutamate forms and then enter various cells by membrane carrier or folate-binding protein-mediated system. The folate --- <!-- Page 119 --> transporter derives from the SLC19 gene family of solute carriers and shares structural homology with the thiamin transporter.43,83 Monoglutamates, mainly 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, are metabolized in the liver and other tissues to polyglutamate derivatives by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase.

The primary form of riboflavin is an integral component of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), the predominant flavoenzyme in body tissues. These coenzymes are involved in multiple oxidation-reduction reactions integral to carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism and are involved in the metabolism of folate, pyridoxine, and niacin. Riboflavin-binding proteins expressed in fetuses of different species are essential to normal fetal development.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Folates function as coenzymes in single-carbon transfer reactions.

Skin immaturity, radiant warmers, and phototherapy often increase insensible losses by as much as 20–40 mL/kg. Insensible losses are high during the first few weeks of life. Up to 200 mL/kg/d of fluid may be needed to maintain normal fluid balance in the preterm neonate.

Careful attention to fluid and salt balance is important to help reduce the risk of pulmonary edema. 1. Fluid and heat losses in the very immature infant (<26 wks gestation) during the first few days after birth can be minimized by keeping the infant in a warm, humidified chamber beneath a radiant warmer.\n2. Fluid balance can be monitored effectively by keeping the infant on a bed scale and measuring body weight at frequent intervals, and by keeping accurate records of fluid intake and urine output.\n3. Frequent measurements of serum electrolytes (every 6 hrs for the very immature infant, every 12 hrs for the infant >26 wks gestation) are important in helping to guide fluid therapy. Sodium is withheld from IV fluids for at least the first 24 hrs and is not added until there is an appropriate diuresis (>2 mL/kg/h) and the weight is at least 5% below birthweight.\n4.

Parenterally fed infants typically require less energy than enterally fed infants, as the energy cost of digestion and absorption is lower with intravenous nutrient delivery, and there are reduced fecal energy losses.14 An additional 30 kcal/kg/d is required for enterally fed neonates to account for these differences.13 Parenteral and enteral energy requirements for term and preterm infants are listed in Tables 7-7 and 7-8. Some infants will require energy intakes greater than the amounts listed to achieve adequate growth. --- <!-- Page 218 --> TABLE 7-7.

Because preterm infants' suck-swallow-breathe coordination does not mature until 32 to 34 weeks of gestational age, they are dependent on tube feedings for up to 12 weeks.73 During this time of tube-feeding dependence, mothers must express their milk every 3 to 4 hours daily to provide adequate volume to feed their infant.61 Maintaining lactation during the often lengthy NICU stay is challenging for many mothers. Mother-infant separation, maternal illness that necessitated preterm delivery, family dynamics, lack of access to appropriate lactation counseling and support, socioeconomic status, transportation, and other factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nfactors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 Preterm MOM is preferred over other milk sources because of its unique nutrient density and bioactivity . It is imperative that mothers receive timely, appropriate, and continued lactation support and education throughout the NICU stay . Mothers who begin milk expression soon after delivery, preferably within 4 hours, will experience earlier lactogenesis and will sustain lactation longer.21 Immediate separation of mother and infant may compromise lactogenesis, but separation is often a medical necessity for preterm infants and mothers . In the preterm MOM-baby dyad, immediate lactation support to advance lactogenesis holds particular importance and requires collaboration from the labor and delivery staff and the NICU staff.31 Mothers require education on milk expression, access to hospital-grade electric breast pumps/supplies, and guidance on the safe handling and storage of expressed milk\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: In pump-dependent mothers of preterm neonates, maintaining an established milk supply requires frequent and effective removal of milk to prevent the Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation (FIL) from accumulating.

In particular, zinc and copper are necessary for growth, and serious complications have been reported when they have not been provided . Table 7-17 provides the typical doses of the most commonly supplemented trace elements .

DHM has less abundant HMOs compared to mother's own milk (MOM).48\n ## Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and the Milk Fat Globule Membrane Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are biologically pertinent fatty acids from the essential fatty acid omega-3 precursor linolenic acid-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the essential fatty acid omega 6 fatty acid linoleic acid-arachidonic acid (ARA) respectively providing impacts on cognitive development.49 Maternal concentrations are very dependent on diet, and genetic guidance affects the amount of transfer to the baby through human milk.50 Recent imaging of infants with increased LCPUFA illustrated enhanced myelin in critical areas of the brain during development.51 For these reasons, it is important for the nutrition support team to also counsel mothers on the impact of dietary intake.52\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n. Higher amounts of DHA are safe, and human milk contains a wide range of DHA; however, research does not conclusively support the benefits of the higher level of DHA found in European formulas.35,39 ## Functional Ingredients in Infant Formulas\n ### DHA and ARA\n\nLong-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) have been shown to play an important role in the neuro-development of infants. DHA and ARA are the most abundant LCPUFAs in the brain; DHA is also found in retinal cells.41--43 DHA and ARA can be obtained from dietary sources or by the endogenous conversion of their precursors, α-linolenic acid (18:3 ω3) and linoleic acid (18:2 ω6).42,43 DHA and ARA occur naturally in human milk, with levels varying based on maternal diet.\n\nDuring pregnancy, DHA and ARA are transported across the placenta to the fetus. Fetuses can synthesize DHA and ARA after 26 weeks of gestation, though the amount produced is highly variable.43 After birth, DHA and ARA are provided via human milk or infant formula supplemented with DHA and/or ARA.

Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease. Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease because of the rapid response of the calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands. Preterm neonates with a chronic depletion of calcium, which can occur via medications such as glucocorticoids, diuretics, and methylxanthines, may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. These patients also have hypophosphatemia but a low tubular reabsorption of phosphate. Serum calcium is not a sensitive marker in screening for metabolic bone disease of prematurity. 43. A.

Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease because of the rapid response of the calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands. Preterm neonates with a chronic depletion of calcium, which can occur via medications such as glucocorticoids, diuretics, and methylxanthines, may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. These patients also have hypophosphatemia but a low tubular reabsorption of phosphate. Serum calcium is not a sensitive marker in screening for metabolic bone disease of prematurity. 43. A.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\ncontraceptives, levothyroxine, insulin, prenatal vitamins) At the expense of the milk bank, donors also need to undergo serologic screening for HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis. ## 13.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations.

Neonates who receive prolonged courses of parenteral nutrition are at risk for developing liver injury and cholestasis.¹ Enteral feedings stimulate bile flow, gallbladder contraction, and intestinal motility. Even trophic feedings can be beneficial in reducing the degree of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. If parenteral nutrition is continued in the presence of cholestasis, manganese and copper should be reduced and plasma levels monitored because these metals can accumulate to toxic levels in the cholestatic liver.

C. Having a donor human milk feeding practice in the neonatal intensive care unit has been associated with increased rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge. Studies have found that a donor human milk feeding practice for preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit does not decrease mother's own milk¹ and leads to higher rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge.² However, there are challenges with using donor milk. For example, neonate growth can be poor because the donated milk typically is obtained from women who are lactating beyond 6 months when the nutrient concentration is lower.³ The amount of protein and zinc are lower in donor human milk than in mother's own milk.⁴\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is based on the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, which requires that all healthcare staff who provide newborn care are trained in the skills necessary to implement the breastfeeding policy.

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown. However, this increase is transient, and treated neonates have similar calcium levels 24 hours after treatment compared with levels in untreated control neonates. Treatment can also blunt the increase in parathyroid hormone concentration that occurs on the first day after birth. The use of total parenteral nutrition with a higher calcium concentration during this period is impractical because calcium phosphate crystals can precipitate in the catheters.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\n24 hours after treatment than do untreated control neonates.

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth.

Lysozyme is an acid-stable enzyme that has 300 times the concentration in human milk compared with cow's milk. Lysozyme is protective against gram-positive bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae.45 In addition to lactoferrin, sIgA, and lysozymes, many other bioactives in human milk act as anti-inflammatory agents and impart immunological benefits.

Abnormal bacterial proliferation is considered a likely factor in the development of NEC, especially in light of the presence of epidemic forms of the disease. F . Feeding, and its relationship to NEC, remain important areas of discussion . Since 90-95% of all infants who develop NEC have been fed, feeding is thought to play a role in NEC . However, the great majority of premature infants who are fed do not develop NEC . **The use of breast milk, and clear and consistent feeding algorithms are recommended as ways to reduce the incidence of NEC.** Lactoferrin, a normal component of human colostrum and milk, can enhance host defense and may be effective in the prevention of sepsis and NEC in preterm neonates .

Pacifier sucking differs from sucking for nutritional intake. In pacifier sucking (nonnutritive sucking), the suck rate is twice as fast as nutritive sucking.25 The infant only has to balance breathing and swallowing until a critical volume of saliva has been collected that will trigger a pharyngeal swallow response. Therefore, infants participating in nonnutritive sucking swallow with significantly less frequency as compared to swallowing frequency during nutritive sucking. This also means that infants sucking on a pacifier do not have to tolerate a swallow apnea with every suck, thus explaining why many nonfeeding infants can non-nutritively suck but have difficulty when a nipple introduces liquid.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nto suck, swallow, and breathe in a coordinated manner is a developmental process.

In pacifier sucking (nonnutritive sucking), the suck rate is twice as fast as nutritive sucking.25 The infant only has to balance breathing and swallowing until a critical volume of saliva has been collected that will trigger a pharyngeal swallow response. Therefore, infants participating in nonnutritive sucking swallow with significantly less frequency as compared to swallowing frequency during nutritive sucking.

These losses are normal and should not be replaced at the risk of fluid overload.2,4,17 In VLBW patients, daily insensible fluid losses are highest during the first few weeks of life and decrease over time, mainly because of maturation and thickening of the skin shortly after birth\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: After birth, both term and preterm neonates experience a contraction of the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

Brain\n\nThe highest amount of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in humans is found in the brain and retina. In the brain cortex, the greatest concentration occurs in the synapses,¹ and in the retina, the highest amount is concentrated in the photoreceptor cells. Preterm neonates have lower amounts of LCPUFAs in the brain and retina because intrauterine acquisition is decreased.²\n\n### References\n\n1. Cotman C, Blank ML, Moehl A, Synder F.

In human studies, casein-predominant formulas result in lower zinc bioavailability than whey-predominant formulas, presumably because of less casein digestion.22 Other types of human whey proteins include secretory IgA and lactoferrin.21 Secretory IgA attaches to the lining of the GI tract and prevents potential pathogenic microorganisms from adhering.9 Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that limits the ability of bacteria to thrive in the intestines. Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nUnited Kingdom: Cambridge University Press; 2006:281-283\n2.

Concentrations of lactoferrin decrease over time and settle at 180 mg/dL by 5 months of lactation.38 Lactoferrin is necessary for iron absorption from human milk and is affected by maternal protein-energy malnutrition.40 Mothers who are protein-energy malnourished but not iron-deficient are lactoferrin-deficient.15\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nof amino acids into circulation.

In human studies, casein-predominant formulas result in lower zinc bioavailability than whey-predominant formulas, presumably because of less casein digestion.22 Other types of human whey proteins include secretory IgA and lactoferrin.21 Secretory IgA attaches to the lining of the GI tract and prevents potential pathogenic microorganisms from adhering.9 Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that limits the ability of bacteria to thrive in the intestines. Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial glycoprotein that is found in significantly higher concentrations in colostrum compared to mature human milk or formulas.

Therefore, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are required in the human diet and are termed \"essential fatty acids.\"1 The shortest chain ω-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid (LA). Humans can convert LA to arachidonic acid (ARA). The shortest chain ω-3 fatty acid is α-linolenic acid (αLA). Humans can convert αLA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and convert EPA very slowly to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The same enzyme pool is used to metabolize LA and αLA to their respective longer-chain metabolites. The more prevalent fatty acid is preferentially metabolized. Thus, with a diet high in the ω-6 fatty acid LA, LA will be preferentially metabolized over the ω-3 fatty acid αLA. ARA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-6) and EPA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-3) are released from membranes and further metabolized to a cascade of eicosanoids. Although it is not quite so simple, eicosanoids from ω-6 fatty acids are generally considered proinflammatory and those from ω-3 fatty acids are considered weakly anti-inflammatory. The docosanoid products of DHA also have anti-inflammatory actions.3\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nrequires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 requires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 Fatty acids and eicosanoids can also change the abundance of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression.

Therefore, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are required in the human diet and are termed \"essential fatty acids.\"1 The shortest chain ω-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid (LA). Humans can convert LA to arachidonic acid (ARA). The shortest chain ω-3 fatty acid is α-linolenic acid (αLA). Humans can convert αLA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and convert EPA very slowly to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The same enzyme pool is used to metabolize LA and αLA to their respective longer-chain metabolites. The more prevalent fatty acid is preferentially metabolized. Thus, with a diet high in the ω-6 fatty acid LA, LA will be preferentially metabolized over the ω-3 fatty acid αLA. ARA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-6) and EPA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-3) are released from membranes and further metabolized to a cascade of eicosanoids.

Therefore, carnitine can aid in reducing TG levels. However, carnitine is not present in PN solutions and may need to be added if deficiency is present, indicated by free carnitine blood levels &lt;8.0 mmol/L. Neonates born prior to 32 to 34 weeks of gestation have been found to be carnitine-deficient because carnitine accretion happens in the last trimester of gestation.⁴⁰ Supplementation as high as 5 to 10 mg/kg/d has been used in patients with elevated TG levels and those on PN longer than 7 days. If carnitine deficiency is present, then up to 50 mg/kg/d may be needed.⁴¹\n\nHeparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase activity by degrading TGs into fatty acid and glycerol.

Using products that contain these preformed EFAs may be beneficial in this population, but evidence is still lacking. Serum triglyceride (TG) levels should be monitored for ILE tolerance. The goal is to have serum TG levels less than 250 mg/dL. Infants prone to hypertriglyceridemia should have their lipids infused over 24 hours at an ILE infusion rate not to exceed 0.15–0.17 g/kg/h (depending on ILE product).³¹ Because of low amounts of lipoprotein lipase in their capillary epithelium that facilitates TG metabolism, infants may benefit from the addition of heparin to the PN at 0.5–1 U/mL of PN to induce the enzyme and improve clearance.³² The addition of the lysine derivative levocarnitine has also been shown to help manage hypertriglyceridemia by transporting long-chain TGs across the cell membrane into the mitochondria.³³\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nby reducing VLDL levels. However, elevated TG levels have been reported in all sources of ILE. Other oil sources include the combination of soybean, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), olive, and fish. ## Carnitine and Heparin\n\nCarnitine is responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation to produce energy. Therefore, carnitine can aid in reducing TG levels. However, carnitine is not present in PN solutions and may need to be added if deficiency is present, indicated by free carnitine blood levels &lt;8.0 mmol/L. Neonates born prior to 32 to 34 weeks of gestation have been found to be carnitine-deficient because carnitine accretion happens in the last trimester of gestation.⁴⁰ Supplementation as high as 5 to 10 mg/kg/d has been used in patients with elevated TG levels and those on PN longer than 7 days. If carnitine deficiency is present, then up to 50 mg/kg/d may be needed.⁴¹\n\nHeparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase activity by degrading TGs into fatty acid and glycerol. This activity is depressed in preterm infants. Infants receiving 1 U/mL heparin had lower TG levels than those receiving 0.5 U/mL or no heparin in the PN solution.⁴⁴\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nand DHA may be required depending on the overall health of the patient.

Lipoprotein lipase in the capillary endothelium releases free fatty acids, which are delivered to tissues by chylomicrons . The fatty acids are carried in the blood bound to albumin and are delivered to the tissues to use for fuel . When fatty acids are used for fuel, they are activated to the fatty acyl-CoA at the outer mitochondrial membrane . Fatty acyl-CoA is the correct high-energy state for β-oxidation, but the enzymes for β-oxidation are located within the mitochondrial matrix (see Figure 4-3), and the fatty acyl-CoA cannot cross the inner membrane of the mitochondria to reach these enzymes\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of triglycerides in circulating chylomicrons and intravenous lipid emulsions into free fatty acids and glycerol.

Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nand on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ and on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ # References 1.

Preterm gestation\n\nThere is a misconception that mothers of very low-birth-weight or extremely low-birth-weight neonates are unable to provide adequate amounts of breast milk to their neonates. Although these women are at increased risk for a delay in lactogenesis and may have stress-related lactation issues, preterm birth itself does not cause insufficient milk volumes.¹⁻³ The main reason for the association of preterm birth with insufficient milk volume is that mothers have inadequate information, equipment, and resources during the first 2 weeks after delivery.⁴\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: While factors such as maternal stress, lack of equipment, and insufficient information contribute to lactation difficulties in mothers of preterm neonates, research indicates that preterm gestation itself is not a physiological cause of insufficient milk volume.

Glutathione\n\nMultiple antioxidant systems, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic, have evolved to counteract oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important nonenzymatic intracellular antioxidant. GSH molecules form a disulfide bond to form oxidized GSH (GSSG) and in the process serve as electron donors, leading to reduction of disulfide bonds. Glutathione reductase then reduces GSSG back to GSH by using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor. Other nonenzymatic antioxidants include transferrin and ceruloplasmin, which can bind transition metals, as well as free radical quenchers, such as uric acid and bilirubin.\n\nEnzymatic pathways of defense against free radical injury include the superoxide dismutase family of antioxidant enzymes, catalases, GSH peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.¹ Newborns, particularly those born preterm, are at increased risk of oxidative stress because of an immature antioxidant system.¹,²\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ncholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 Selenium is critical for antioxidant capacity, primarily through glutathione peroxidase, for immune function, and as a cofactor for thyroid hormone production and regulation; needs may be increased with critical illness and thermal injury.55,63 Selenium deficiency may present as cardiomyopathy (ie, Keshan disease), myalgias, myositis, hemolysis, and impaired cellular immunity.55,63\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Selenium is an essential trace element that serves as a critical cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which protects cells from oxidative damage by reducing lipid hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide.

The more complicated infants have greater duodenal dysmotility and may have required a tapering enteroplasty; they often have a G-tube inserted to facilitate gastric decompression, thereby protecting the anastomosis, and allowing the infant greater success in extubating from mechanical ventilation without a nasogastric tube in place.

For neonates with difficulty latching or maintaining a seal, a nipple shield, proper head support, and proper positioning are helpful. Neonates with a disorganized sucking, swallowing, and breathing sequence may benefit from swaddling to assist with state regulation, cue-based feedings, and pacing.
