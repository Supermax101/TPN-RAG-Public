Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL.

Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W.

Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? which prevents feeding accumulation and can serve as an energy source for bacteria. Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg. This corresponds to a total protein dose of approximately 4 to 4.5 g/d.

However, until an optimal multitrace element product is developed, one mechanism for dose-adjusting trace elements based on age-specific or disease-specific needs is to supplement PN solutions with copper, selenium, and zinc using the single-entity products instead of the multitrace element products. Thus, accumulation of chromium and manganese can be avoided. For institutions using multitrace element products, supplemental zinc may be required in certain patients, such as preterm infants and those with increased GI losses. In addition, routine monitoring of copper in patients with cholestasis and of chromium and manganese in all patients is advised.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nconditions that require additional zinc intake include elevated urinary zinc excretion (eg, high-output renal failure) and increased GI excretion (eg, high-volume stool loss, fistula/stoma losses). conditions that require additional zinc intake include elevated urinary zinc excretion (eg, high-output renal failure) and increased GI excretion (eg, high-volume stool loss, fistula/stoma losses). conditions that require additional zinc intake include elevated urinary zinc excretion (eg, high-output renal failure) and increased GI excretion (eg, high-volume stool loss, fistula/stoma losses). Parenteral multitrace element products that contain zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium are available (see Table 33-6); single-entity products exist for copper, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc.65,66 Dosing of pediatric multitrace element products is problematic in that the weight-based dosage recommendations underestimate the recommended daily intake for some trace elements such as zinc, while intake is excessive for others like manganese that are contaminants in PN solutions and can accumulate in patients receiving long-term PN support (see Table 33-7).\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\namounts provided through contamination of other additives.

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\nand generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: and generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: and generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: 1.

However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively.

Also, referred to as \"vanilla bags\" or \"day of life 1 PN,\" these solutions are started soon --- <!-- Page 232 --> after birth and are intended to prevent the catabolic processes that can result in additional muscle mass loss. These solutions provide sufficient energy and protein and sufficient calcium to prevent hypocalcemia.

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\nand generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: and generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: and generally 2 g/kg/d for adolescents.²⁷,²⁸ After a review of organ function, medication profile, and serum concentrations, electrolytes are adjusted according to the following general guidelines: 1. Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\ntherapeutic doses.\n # Insulin\n\nBecause the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended.[64]\n # Special Situations therapeutic doses.\n # Insulin\n\nBecause the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended.[64]\n # Special Situations\n # Starter PN Evidence has demonstrated that early PN administration in preterm LBW neonates can improve growth and potentially neurodevelopment. Within hours of delivery, a solution of protein (as amino acids, fat [in the form of ILE], and carbohydrates [as dextrose]) is administered until a customized PN can be compounded. Also, referred to as \"vanilla bags\" or \"day of life 1 PN,\" these solutions are started soon --- <!-- Page 232 --> after birth and are intended to prevent the catabolic processes that can result in additional muscle mass loss. These solutions provide sufficient energy and protein and sufficient calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. Typical starter PNs contain dextrose, amino acids, and calcium but are free of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

The provision of adequate calcium and phosphorus in an optimal ratio is important for bone mineralization in neonates and infants, particularly those born preterm since maximum calcium and phosphorus accretion rates occur over the last 6 weeks of gestation. Providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of $1.7\\mathrm{mg}$ calcium to $1\\mathrm{mg}$ phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary losses.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\npreterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively.

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings. Thus, for patients whose feedings are changing or at high risk for feeding intolerance, it may be better not to include the feeds in the daily PN order.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nassessing the triene-to-tetraene ratio for various age groups .

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively.

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings. Thus, for patients whose feedings are changing or at high risk for feeding intolerance, it may be better not to include the feeds in the daily PN order.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nassessing the triene-to-tetraene ratio for various age groups .

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus. Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n\n---\n[Source: UCSF Neonatal TPN.md]\n(DOL, day of life; pulm., pulmonary; PPHN, persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn; MAS meconium aspiration syndrome) 4. **Electrolyte requirements** are stated on the parenteral nutrition order form and must be adjusted according to serum values and clinical condition.

Specially formulated amino acid blends may be extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease). To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth.

Specially formulated amino acid blends may be extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease). To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth. Infants only provided dextrose-containing fluids would continue to break down muscle mass that is difficult to regain.
