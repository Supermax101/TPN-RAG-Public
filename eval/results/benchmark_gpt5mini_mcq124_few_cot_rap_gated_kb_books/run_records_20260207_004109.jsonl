In a suitably humidified environment, appropriate initial rates of IV fluid intake for the premature infant are: >28 wks gestation: 60-80 mL/kg\n26-28 wks gestation: 80-100 mL/kg\n<26 wks gestation: 100-120 mL/kg 5. These guidelines assume close monitoring of body weight, intake/output measurements, and serum sodium as noted above. 6. After the brisk diuresis that usually occurs during the first 3-7 days, urine output generally decreases to about 2-4 mL/kg/h, and fluid intake can be adjusted to about 120-150 mL/kg/d. 7. Once on full enteral nutrition, infants without evidence of CHF or renal dysfunction can almost always tolerated greater intake volumes, e.g., 160-180 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part2.md]\nlevels in utero that result in pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia.

Therefore, they may be relatively hyperinsulinemic at birth, resulting in higher than normal glucose requirements and hypoglycemia. E. Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W. We may infuse concentrations between D3W and D12.5W through a peripheral IV. Higher concentrations require central access. F.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\ntherapeutic doses.\n # Insulin\n\nBecause the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended.[64]\n # Special Situations therapeutic doses.\n # Insulin\n\nBecause the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended.[64]\n # Special Situations\n # Starter PN Evidence has demonstrated that early PN administration in preterm LBW neonates can improve growth and potentially neurodevelopment. Within hours of delivery, a solution of protein (as amino acids, fat [in the form of ILE], and carbohydrates [as dextrose]) is administered until a customized PN can be compounded. Also, referred to as \"vanilla bags\" or \"day of life 1 PN,\" these solutions are started soon --- <!-- Page 232 --> after birth and are intended to prevent the catabolic processes that can result in additional muscle mass loss. These solutions provide sufficient energy and protein and sufficient calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. Typical starter PNs contain dextrose, amino acids, and calcium but are free of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Some programs also provide ILE as part of the starter PN provision.65\n\n---\n[Source: 2022-NICU New Fellow PN_072022_part1.md]\nnutrition for our babies!

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings. Thus, for patients whose feedings are changing or at high risk for feeding intolerance, it may be better not to include the feeds in the daily PN order.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Fluids_Electrolytes_and_Acid_Base_Disorders_Handbook_Second_Edition.md]\nthe amount of additional fluids administered (eg, maintenance IV fluids, concomitant medications), cardiac function, and Fluids, Electrolytes, and Acid-Base Disorders Handbook --- <!-- Page 251 --> the amount of additional fluids administered (eg, maintenance IV fluids, concomitant medications), cardiac function, and Fluids, Electrolytes, and Acid-Base Disorders Handbook --- <!-- Page 251 --> the amount of additional fluids administered (eg, maintenance IV fluids, concomitant medications), cardiac function, and Fluids, Electrolytes, and Acid-Base Disorders Handbook --- <!-- Page 251 --> clinical status.

The amount and method of advancement of lipid emulsions in preterm neonates during the first few days after birth varies widely, but generally, most neonatal intensive care units aim to achieve a maximum total of 3 to 4 g/kg/d.¹ The most common solution used in the United States for preterm neonates, Intralipid, consists of 100% soybean oil.

To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth.

Question: What would be your initial action, and how would you monitor the effectiveness of your PN regimen? Comment: This patient is anticipated to be NPO for an extended period. PN should be started, and L-cysteine supplementation should be considered. The best method for protein evaluation and overall nutrition status in this patient would be daily weights and longitudinal assessment of visceral proteins, such as transthyretin and albumin, and nitrogen balance if feasible. Question: What is the estimated protein requirement for this infant? Comment: Because this infant is preterm and critically ill due to necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.5 to 3 g/kg of protein should be provided and dosed based on the birth weight of 1.6 kg.

Obtaining a capillary blood glucose concentration 30 minutes to 1 hour after the PN formulation is discontinued will help identify rebound hypoglycemia. ### Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency ILE is generally provided as a source of essential fatty acids and as a nonprotein energy source . Although the incidence is low, several potential complications are associated with ILE use, such as infusion-related adverse reactions and allergy to the ILE components . Depending on the length of the PN therapy and the nutrition status of the patient, ILE-free PN may result in essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) . Two polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and α-linolenic acid, cannot be synthesized by the body and are considered essential . Clinical manifestations of EFAD include scaly dermatitis, alopecia, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, fatty liver, and anemia.10 Biochemical evidence of EFAD is determined by a triene-to-tetraene ratio of >0.2 and can occur within 1--3 weeks in adults receiving ILE-free PN.11 The adult requirements for linoleic acid are met through exogenous sources or endogenously through the lipolysis of adipose tissue\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nAcid (EFA) Deficiency Monitoring: EFA deficiency may develop in 1-3 weeks on no/low exogenous EFA delivery.

His requirement for protein accretion for optimal growth is 3.5 to 4 g/kg/d. Extremely low-birth-weight neonates require 3.5 to 4 g/kg/d of protein to meet their caloric needs. Intravenous glucose infusions should be started at a rate of 5 to 6 mg/kg/min and could be increased up to 12 mg/kg/min. Beyond that amount, there may be resultant carbon dioxide retention, which could be an issue in neonates receiving ventilation. Extremely preterm neonates have a resting energy expenditure of approximately 50 kcal/kg/d, with a fecal energy loss of approximately 10 kcal/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nare not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants.16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements. are not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants.16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements. are not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants.16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements. Parenterally fed infants typically require less energy than enterally fed infants, as the energy cost of digestion and absorption is lower with intravenous nutrient delivery, and there are reduced fecal energy losses.14 An additional 30 kcal/kg/d is required for enterally fed neonates to account for these differences.13 Parenteral and enteral energy requirements for term and preterm infants are listed in Tables 7-7 and 7-8.

A standard parenteral infusion of 3 g/kg/day amino acids, 10% dextrose, and 3 grams/kg/day lipid at 100 mL/kg/day would provide 82 kcal/kg/day, according to the following calculations: 3 grams amino acids × 4 kcal/gram = 12 kcal; 10 grams of dextrose × 4 kcal/gram = 40 kcal; 3 grams/kg/day of lipid would add 30 kcal/kg/day. c. Cholestasis or parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) is more common in infants (extremely preterm infants, and those with short gut syndromes such as gastroschisis or those with severe enteral feeding intolerance) who receive parenteral nutrition exclusively and for prolonged periods (weeks, vs. days).\n\n---\n[Source: Averys_Neonatology_Nutrition_and_Renal.md]\nintermittent hypoxia, stress with increased catabolic hormone secretion, and sepsis.\n\n- By term: preterm infants are shorter and lighter than term infants (with relatively more fat than lean mass)\n ## ENERGY REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Energy needs for preterm infants to achieve normal growth rates (Table 23.1).\n\n- Total energy intake must be sufficient to support basal metabolism (~50 kcal/kg/day)\n- Growth requires additional energy (25–35 kcal/kg/day)\n- Energy lost in stools increases with enteral feeding (5–10 kcal/kg/day)\n- Physical activity accounts for 1%–2% of total energy expenditure in preterm infants\n- Total energy needs are reduced by 5–10 kcal/kg/day for infants in incubators/radiant warmers\n\n- There is no evidence that energy intake above normal levels enhances neurologic development or achieves appropriate growth and body composition.\n- Higher energy intakes in preterm infants result in greater fat accumulation compared to normally growing fetuses of the same GA.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nweek of gestation.

Infants will require vitamin D supplementation to meet the recommended dietary allowance until taking at least 24 oz/d.[95,96]\n\n---\n[Source: Children_s_Health_Pediatric_Nutrition_Handbook_2023.md]\npowder to provide additional calories up to 30 kcal/oz\n- Use liquid protein for additional calories or oil for an additional 2 kcal/oz\n- Example: Similac® HMF Hydrolyzed Protein Concentrated Liquid powder to provide additional calories up to 30 kcal/oz\n- Use liquid protein for additional calories or oil for an additional 2 kcal/oz\n- Example: Similac® HMF Hydrolyzed Protein Concentrated Liquid\n ### Premature Formula - Typically used for infants with birth weight &lt;1800 g, up to a current weight of 2500 g (Enfamil® Premature) or 3600 g (Similac® Special Care), or as medically appropriate Pediatric Nutrition Handbook\n251 --- <!-- Page 255 --> - Not commercially available for purchase (patients generally not sent home on these)\n- As appropriate, transition to premature discharge/transitional formula -1 week before discharge\n- Examples: Similac® Special Care®, Enfamil® Premature\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <source-grounded reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Preterm infants are typically transitioned to a preterm discharge/transitional formula at discharge; these formulas are enriched with protein and minerals and are standard at 22 kcal/oz (examples Similac Neosure/EnfaCare).

Starter PN solutions are often used in institutions with newborn intensive care units to provide early protein provision until an individual PN solution can be prescribed, compounded, and available for administration. These starter solutions contain dextrose and amino acids and may also contain a minimum amount of additives such as calcium and heparin. Preterm infants, particularly those weighing <1500 g, are also prone to reflux, generalized GI dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying.6 Organized gut motility does not begin until 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.7 PN is weaned slowly as EN intake, oral intake, or both increase so that the overall nutrient intake remains optimal during this transition.\n\n---\n[Source: 9_AcidBaseDisorders.md]\nNUTRITION SUPPORT\nCERTIFICATE Upon admission to the hospital and continuation of PN, what change should be made based on RK's ABG? to multiple days of high volume emesis.\n- Laboratory values:\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nand the neonate will become catabolic and break down their protein stores for energy. Neonates with severe respiratory failure, congenital heart defects, or NEC often receive PN initially.66 ## Compounding PN for the Neonate In addition to the calcium and phosphorus compatibility issues, other compounding factors have been the focus of recent attention in hopes of preventing PN-related complications in the neonate. These include minimizing aluminum exposure, protecting the solutions from light, and avoidance of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate--containing materials. Preterm infants and children with intestinal failure have immature or diminished antioxidant defenses that render them more susceptible to oxidant stress that can influence the selection of many PN additives.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The infant has hypernatremia and elevated BUN suggesting relative hypovolemia/dehydration, so fluids should be increased to ~125 mL/kg/day.

ILE provides 20% - 30% of total energy as ILE: 2400 kcal/d × 0.2 to 0.3 = 480 - 720 kcal/d.

ILE 30% provides 3 kcal/mL; therefore, 720 kcal/d ÷ 3 kcal/mL = 240 mL.

While solubility limits within PN solutions prohibit the supply of minerals provided in utero during the last trimester (6–7.5 mEq/kg/d calcium and 2.3–2.7 mmol/kg/d phosphorus), providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of 1.7 mg calcium to 1 mg phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary TABLE 33-4.

Because magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium needs increase with anabolism and are carbohydrate dependent, repletion levels of these minerals may be needed for the first few days of PN. However, neonates starting PN within 24 hours after birth should receive only calcium for the first day.\n2. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus administration is adjusted according to changes in the serum concentrations, acid-base balance, drug therapy, and the use of renal replacement or dialysis therapy. Elevated serum or capillary glucose concentrations or fluid volume intolerance may preclude an increase in dextrose intake or PN volume, respectively. If fluid restriction is necessary, the required amounts of protein and energy substrate are concentrated within the volume tolerated.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\npreterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus. Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4). preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus. Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n ### Calcium and phosphorus The provision of adequate calcium and phosphorus in an optimal ratio is important for bone mineralization in neonates and infants, particularly those born preterm since maximum calcium and phosphorus accretion rates occur over the last 6 weeks of gestation. While solubility limits within PN solutions prohibit the supply of minerals provided in utero during the last trimester (6–7.5 mEq/kg/d calcium and 2.3–2.7 mmol/kg/d phosphorus), providing calcium and phosphorus in a ratio of 1.7 mg calcium to 1 mg phosphorus optimizes bone accretion of both minerals and minimizes urinary TABLE 33-4.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

At the beginning of the third trimester, lactase activity is approximately 25% of that at term.14,16 In most individuals, lactase activity begins to decline with advancing age.17 This genetically predetermi --- <!-- Page 52 -->\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <source-grounded reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The retrieved TPN knowledge base explicitly states \"Lactase activity in infant <34 weeks' gestation is 30% of normal term infant.\" ASPEN references note low third‑trimester activity (~25% early in the third trimester), but the direct context for <34 weeks supports 30%.\n\nAnswer: C","parsed_answer":"C","correct":true,"retrieval_context_hash":"8f48924cab2662b6c3a10025d829abe87268f0f05395d1d6485efb6deabc248d","retrieval_snapshot_id":"e0a9b9021ae14143b3fe54e668bd5003","latency_ms":5380.676984786987,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7284094766546887,"rag_context_chars":5864,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":1.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

It should be noted that the commercially available multiple trace element combinations in the United States contain 3–5 times the recommended dosages for manganese and may contribute to complications in long-term patients. See Table 4-6 for trace element supplementation for PN.²⁹⁻³¹ Other trace elements that may be supplemented in PN include molybdenum, iodine, and iron.²⁹ Three injectable iron products are available, all as single-entity products. Only iron dextran is approved for addition to PN admixtures, but this should only be considered for dextrose/amino acid (2-in-1) formulations because ILEs are disrupted by iron.³⁰ Table 4-6.

Clinicians must consider the addition of certain trace elements, such as chromium and manganese, because of their contamination within other PN components.107 When a patient has been receiving PN for several months or has developed cholestasis, it is important to assess the status of those trace elements.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <source-grounded reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Retrieved neonatal PN guidance and NeoReviews cite manganese excess as leading to basal ganglia deposition and resultant neurotoxicity; combination trace-element products often contain 3–5× the recommended manganese dose for neonates, increasing this risk.

The ASPEN Novel Nutrient Task Force recommends routine carnitine supplementation of 2 to 5 mg/kg/d to neonatal PN if no enteral source was provided.47 ### Cysteine Cysteine has been considered a conditionally essential amino acid in neonates and infants because of the enzymatic immaturity of the transsulfuration pathway responsible for the conversion of methionine to cysteine and ultimately to taurine.73 Cysteine is not a component of crystalline amino acid solutions because it is unstable and will form an insoluble precipitate.21 Common dosing for L-cysteine hydrochloride is 30 to 40 mg/g of pediatric amino acids; however, 20 mg/g may be adequate.74 In general, current practice suggests supplementation with L-cysteine hydrochloride for the first year of life, although actual practice varies widely.20 Riedijk et al75 have suggested that cysteine requirements are satisfied in 1-month-old preterm infants born at 32 weeks of gestation or older who are on a full enteral diet\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n<!-- Page 84 --> Herrera and Helms of parenteral and enteral nutrition in adult and pediatric patients.

However, apart from its critical role in the maintenance of bone and mineral metabolism, its cause-and-effect relationship with other clinical disorders remains to be defined.10--12 ### Sources Endogenous synthesis of vitamin D3 requires exposure to sunlight or irradiation in the ultraviolet B range. It is extremely efficient, and a 10-minute to 15-minute whole-body exposure to peak summer sun will generate and release up to 500 mcg (20,000 IU) of vitamin D3 into the circulation.58,59 Cutaneous production of vitamin D3 is substantially diminished by decreased exposure to sunlight from seasonal changes or time of day, clouds, aerosols, thick ozone, higher latitude, aging, clothing, sunscreen use, and melanin pigmentation.59 In dark-skinned individuals, endogenous synthesis of vitamin D is possible, although the rate of production is lower than in less-pigmented individuals. Concerns regarding the hazards of ultraviolet radiation exposure have led to revised recommendations for sunlight exposure.60 Consequently, ensuring adequate vitamin D status, especially in the presence of factors that affect its endogenous synthesis, requires attention to dietary vitamin D supplementation.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <source-grounded reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: ASPEN and NeoReviews state that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is the major circulating metabolite and reflects cumulative sunlight exposure and dietary intake, making it a good marker of vitamin D status.

These coenzymes are involved in multiple oxidation-reduction reactions integral to carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism and are involved in the metabolism of folate, pyridoxine, and niacin. Riboflavin-binding proteins expressed in fetuses of different species are essential to normal fetal development.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <step-by-step reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Folate coenzymes mediate one-carbon transfers and are required for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and for histidine degradation (via FIGLU → glutamate).

Polyglutamates are the forms retained in various tissues or found in blood or bile and are the forms needed for function as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfer reactions. Folate catabolism involves the cleavage of intracellular and circulatory polyglutamates to the monoglutamate form. Approximately two-thirds of the folate in plasma is protein-bound, and albumin accounts for approximately 50% of the bound folate. Folates filter freely through the glomeruli and are secreted and reabsorbed by the renal tubules. The bulk of the urine excretory products are folate cleavage products, mainly in the monoglutamate form. Extensive enterohepatic circulation of folate occurs.84 The estimated total body folate content is between 12 and 28 mg, of which approximately 50% is in the liver.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nto all enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meal, pasta products, rice, and other cereal grain products sold in the United States.

Because preterm infants' suck-swallow-breathe coordination does not mature until 32 to 34 weeks of gestational age, they are dependent on tube feedings for up to 12 weeks.73 During this time of tube-feeding dependence, mothers must express their milk every 3 to 4 hours daily to provide adequate volume to feed their infant.61 Maintaining lactation during the often lengthy NICU stay is challenging for many mothers. Mother-infant separation, maternal illness that necessitated preterm delivery, family dynamics, lack of access to appropriate lactation counseling and support, socioeconomic status, transportation, and other factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nfactors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 factors may contribute to a mother's success or failure to maintain lactation.74 Many pump-dependent mothers experience a reduction in milk supply when they are not able to latch their infant.75 Preterm MOM is preferred over other milk sources because of its unique nutrient density and bioactivity . It is imperative that mothers receive timely, appropriate, and continued lactation support and education throughout the NICU stay . Mothers who begin milk expression soon after delivery, preferably within 4 hours, will experience earlier lactogenesis and will sustain lactation longer.21 Immediate separation of mother and infant may compromise lactogenesis, but separation is often a medical necessity for preterm infants and mothers .

Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? A. Because there are several biologically plausible mechanisms for human milk's role in the prevention of NEC, such as antigen-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins, as well as multiple observational studies demonstrating a protective effect compared with the effects of infant formula, mother's own milk is the preferred feeding choice for this neonate. B. Donor milk and mother's own milk have the same composition of bioactive factors and have equivalent protective effect on NEC; therefore, this mother should not be encouraged to pump during the hospitalization if donor milk is available.

DHM has less abundant HMOs compared to mother's own milk (MOM).48\n ## Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and the Milk Fat Globule Membrane Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are biologically pertinent fatty acids from the essential fatty acid omega-3 precursor linolenic acid-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the essential fatty acid omega 6 fatty acid linoleic acid-arachidonic acid (ARA) respectively providing impacts on cognitive development.49 Maternal concentrations are very dependent on diet, and genetic guidance affects the amount of transfer to the baby through human milk.50 Recent imaging of infants with increased LCPUFA illustrated enhanced myelin in critical areas of the brain during development.51 For these reasons, it is important for the nutrition support team to also counsel mothers on the impact of dietary intake.52\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\n. Higher amounts of DHA are safe, and human milk contains a wide range of DHA; however, research does not conclusively support the benefits of the higher level of DHA found in European formulas.35,39 ## Functional Ingredients in Infant Formulas\n ### DHA and ARA\n\nLong-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) have been shown to play an important role in the neuro-development of infants. DHA and ARA are the most abundant LCPUFAs in the brain; DHA is also found in retinal cells.41--43 DHA and ARA can be obtained from dietary sources or by the endogenous conversion of their precursors, α-linolenic acid (18:3 ω3) and linoleic acid (18:2 ω6).42,43 DHA and ARA occur naturally in human milk, with levels varying based on maternal diet.\n\nDuring pregnancy, DHA and ARA are transported across the placenta to the fetus. Fetuses can synthesize DHA and ARA after 26 weeks of gestation, though the amount produced is highly variable.43 After birth, DHA and ARA are provided via human milk or infant formula supplemented with DHA and/or ARA. Infants fed formula without supplementation have been shown to have lower levels of DHA in the brain.43\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: LCPUFAs (notably DHA and ARA) are most abundant in the brain and retina, with the greatest concentration in synaptic membranes.

Fetuses can synthesize DHA and ARA after 26 weeks of gestation, though the amount produced is highly variable.43 After birth, DHA and ARA are provided via human milk or infant formula supplemented with DHA and/or ARA.

Lysozyme is an acid-stable enzyme that has 300 times the concentration in human milk compared with cow's milk. Lysozyme is protective against gram-positive bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae.45 In addition to lactoferrin, sIgA, and lysozymes, many other bioactives in human milk act as anti-inflammatory agents and impart immunological benefits.

Neonates who receive prolonged courses of parenteral nutrition are at risk for developing liver injury and cholestasis.¹ Enteral feedings stimulate bile flow, gallbladder contraction, and intestinal motility. Even trophic feedings can be beneficial in reducing the degree of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. If parenteral nutrition is continued in the presence of cholestasis, manganese and copper should be reduced and plasma levels monitored because these metals can accumulate to toxic levels in the cholestatic liver.

Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? approach the mother to discuss feeding type, and she indicates that she plans to provide infant formula only. Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)? A. Because there are several biologically plausible mechanisms for human milk's role in the prevention of NEC, such as antigen-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins, as well as multiple observational studies demonstrating a protective effect compared with the effects of infant formula, mother's own milk is the preferred feeding choice for this neonate. B. Donor milk and mother's own milk have the same composition of bioactive factors and have equivalent protective effect on NEC; therefore, this mother should not be encouraged to pump during the hospitalization if donor milk is available. C. Human milk may have an even more protective effect if pasteurized to eliminate potential pathogenic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <source-grounded reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Holder pasteurization preserves many macronutrients and oligosaccharides but reduces heat-sensitive bioactive proteins; lysozyme quantity and activity are diminished in donor milk after pasteurization.

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown.

The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Pharmacol. 2008;21(2):381-385 31. D. The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium. Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown. However, this increase is transient, and treated neonates have similar calcium levels 24 hours after treatment compared with levels in untreated control neonates. Treatment can also blunt the increase in parathyroid hormone concentration that occurs on the first day after birth. The use of total parenteral nutrition with a higher calcium concentration during this period is impractical because calcium phosphate crystals can precipitate in the catheters.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\n24 hours after treatment than do untreated control neonates.

Advancing her feedings by 4 mL per feeding daily, as opposed to 2 mL per feeding, is more likely to lead to decreased overall parenteral nutrition use without an increase in risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. Many studies have attempted to decipher the ideal approach to providing enteral nutrition to preterm neonates. Randomized controlled trials have found that preterm neonates who received a faster feeding advancement (30 mL/kg/d compared with 15-20 mL/kg/d) achieved full feedings earlier, had shorter hospital stays, and required a shorter period to regain birth weight without a greater risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.¹²\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <source-grounded reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: MEN (trophic) feeds are small (about 12–24 mL/kg/day) and studies show initiating MEN within the first 2–4 days can stimulate gut development, prevent intestinal atrophy, and is associated with decreased parenteral nutrition use, improved weight gain, and earlier attainment of full enteral feeds.

Magnesium plays a critical role in the functioning of the Na^{+}-K^{+}-ATPase pump, thus affecting neuromuscular transmission, cardiovascular excitability, vasomotor tone, and muscle contraction. Magnesium is also an integral component of bone and parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Magnesium is found primarily in the ICF, with only about 2% of total body stores found in the ECF. More than 50% of the magnesium in the body resides in bone. About 61% of serum magnesium is physiologically active in the ionized form, 33% protein bound, and 5% complexed to phosphate, citrate, and other compounds.49,50\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\na protein-bound (~30%) and an ultrafiltrable (~70%) portion.

It is critical for normal ATP function and glucose metabolism, and it is necessary for both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Mg is also important in cellular cytoskeleton contraction and at the myoneural junction; in this role, it can alter skeletal and cardiac muscle function. Among numerous other cell functions, Mg catalyzes enzymatic processes for the transfer, storage, and use of energy and regulates movement of potassium and Ca across cell membranes.

Some Ca compounds, such as calcium citrate, are better absorbed than calcium carbonate in individuals with decreased gastric acid. About 90% of the Ca absorbed is through the small intestine, and the large intestine can absorb the remainder.[23] Dietary Ca absorption, particularly in young children, is primarily regulated by Ca rather than vitamin D intake.[1,2,24-26] At high dietary Ca intake, paracellular absorption takes place throughout the small intestine and depends on the concentration gradient. At low Ca intake, transcellular absorption takes place largely in the duodenum and is dependent on 1,25(OH)₂D.[27] The role of 1,25(OH)₂D in epithelial transport, including TABLE 6-2.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

This density benefits patients who have limited stomach capacity, fluid restrictions, and/or increased caloric needs (eg, growth or critical illness). A typical fatty acid is a chain of 4 to 24 hydrocarbons with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at one end (see Figure 4-1). The degree of saturation of a fatty acid is determined by how many double bonds it contains: saturated contains no double bonds, monounsaturated contains 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated contains 2 or more double bonds. Although often unbranched, fatty acid chains may include hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, and rings. Fatty acids can also be described by chain length (see Figure 4-2), however, no consensus currently exists on this axis of classification. Most definitions describe short chains as a string of 2 to 6 carbons, while a medium chain has 8 to 12, and a long chain has 14 or more. These lengths contribute to the physical characteristics of the food and the metabolism of the fat once it enters the body.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nPA: Saunders; 2004:342–347\n2.

E. The patient can now start enteral feedings at 10 to 20 mL/kg/d with maternal breast milk, with addition of donor human if there is not yet enough maternal breast milk. Mother's own milk is the ideal type of milk to provide to preterm neonates. If this is not available or volumes are inadequate, donor milk is recommended for neonates with a birth weight less than 1,500 g or birth gestational age younger than 32 weeks.¹,² If donor milk or mother's own milk is not available, enteral feedings should not be withheld beyond 1 day after birth because data from animal studies suggest that intestinal villous atrophy might occur without feedings.³ Once very low-birth-weight or extremely low-birth-weight neonates are receiving full-volume feedings, caloric fortification is recommended to maximize growth and bone density.⁴ References\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <source-grounded reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Studies in preterm animal models (preterm pigs) of minimal enteral nutrition/trophic feeds (eg, small volumes of breast milk) show stimulation of GI development including improved gut motility and greater activity of digestive enzymes and prevention of intestinal atrophy.

Concentrations of lactoferrin decrease over time and settle at 180 mg/dL by 5 months of lactation.38 Lactoferrin is necessary for iron absorption from human milk and is affected by maternal protein-energy malnutrition.40 Mothers who are protein-energy malnourished but not iron-deficient are lactoferrin-deficient.15\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nof amino acids into circulation.

In human studies, casein-predominant formulas result in lower zinc bioavailability than whey-predominant formulas, presumably because of less casein digestion.22 Other types of human whey proteins include secretory IgA and lactoferrin.21 Secretory IgA attaches to the lining of the GI tract and prevents potential pathogenic microorganisms from adhering.9 Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that limits the ability of bacteria to thrive in the intestines. Because this protein is biochemically similar to transferrin, it may have a significant role in iron absorption. However, in vivo studies have not definitively established this role.23 Also, some evidence suggests that lactoferrin has a role in stimulating intestinal mucosa growth.24 These 2 proteins found in human milk, secretory IgA and lactoferrin, and the main protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, are not well digested in early infancy.24,25 In fact, approximately 10% of intact milk proteins are found in infant stools before 1 month of age, decreasing to about 3% at 4 months of age.24\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Lactoferrin is most abundant in human colostrum (approximately 600 mg/dL) and concentrations decline over time to much lower levels in mature/hind milk (≈180 mg/dL by 5 months).

Glucose is the primary source of energy in PN, but glucose oxidation varies depending on age and diagnosis.53,54 Glucose infusion rates that are more than the patients' oxidative capacity will promote fat deposition.43 While glucose infusion rates vary, an intake >10 mg/kg/min may result in the conversion of glucose to fat.44 However, anecdotally, glucose infusion rates up to 15 mg/kg/min appear to be well tolerated in infants and young children . An amino acid solution, ranging from 3 to 4 g/kg/d for preterm infants to 1 g/kg/d for adolescents, is administered to support protein metabolism.55 Amino acids are best utilized when balanced with a proper proportion of nonnitrogen calories\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Preterm neonates should start PN dextrose at approximately endogenous production rates of 4–6 mg/kg/min, with gradual daily increases of 1–2 mg/kg/min to avoid exceeding oxidative capacity.

Therefore, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are required in the human diet and are termed \"essential fatty acids.\"1 The shortest chain ω-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid (LA). Humans can convert LA to arachidonic acid (ARA). The shortest chain ω-3 fatty acid is α-linolenic acid (αLA). Humans can convert αLA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and convert EPA very slowly to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The same enzyme pool is used to metabolize LA and αLA to their respective longer-chain metabolites. The more prevalent fatty acid is preferentially metabolized. Thus, with a diet high in the ω-6 fatty acid LA, LA will be preferentially metabolized over the ω-3 fatty acid αLA. ARA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-6) and EPA (20-carbon polyunsaturated ω-3) are released from membranes and further metabolized to a cascade of eicosanoids. Although it is not quite so simple, eicosanoids from ω-6 fatty acids are generally considered proinflammatory and those from ω-3 fatty acids are considered weakly anti-inflammatory. The docosanoid products of DHA also have anti-inflammatory actions.3\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nrequires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 requires a large amount of essential fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids in particular, to achieve the type of growth usually experienced by a fetus in utero during the same period postconception.6,7 Fatty acids and eicosanoids can also change the abundance of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression. Regulation of gene expression by nutrients is critically important in preterm neonates.

In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nand on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ and on the face, fingers, and trunk. $^{1}$ Affected neonates are also at risk for alopecia, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and irritability, although these are less common findings. $^{1-3}$ # References 1.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all neonates, including those born preterm, receive human milk feedings. However, certain maternal demographic characteristics are potential obstacles for human milk use, especially in preterm neonates. Of the following, the maternal demographic characteristic most likely to present an obstacle to human milk feeding in preterm neonates is:\nA. High school education\nB. Language barrier\nC.

Low income In the United States, women who are African American and have a low income are more likely to deliver a very low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonate. This group is also less likely to initiate breastfeeding. This has implications in studies that are examining the benefit of breast milk for VLBW neonates because low-income families may be underrepresented. --- <!-- Page 387 --> Fluids, Electrolytes, Nutrition\n379\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nImmunoglobulin A and G levels are decreased slightly.

Folate supplementation has been implicated in delayed diagnosis of pernicious anemia until after irreversible neurological damage has occurred.83,86 These risks are increased in cases of reduced hepatic transformation of folic acid (eg, caused by genetic variants or during some pharmacotherapies). 5-MTHF may be a better alternative to folic acid supplementation because it is immediately available as a methyl donor in many metabolic reactions. Additionally, it does not accumulate in blood\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 120 -->\n\nlike folic acid does in cases of reduced hepatic transformation.

Cysteine\nCysteine is required for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, helps to maintain redox potential, and assists with calcium homeostasis. In newborns, cysteine is a semiessential amino acid because of impaired cysteine production.¹ As a result, cysteine is routinely added to amino acid preparations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of its poor solubility, cysteine is often added last to the amino acid solution. References\n1.  Van Goudoever JB, Sulkers EJ, Timmerman M, et al.

Glutathione\n\nMultiple antioxidant systems, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic, have evolved to counteract oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important nonenzymatic intracellular antioxidant. GSH molecules form a disulfide bond to form oxidized GSH (GSSG) and in the process serve as electron donors, leading to reduction of disulfide bonds. Glutathione reductase then reduces GSSG back to GSH by using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor. Other nonenzymatic antioxidants include transferrin and ceruloplasmin, which can bind transition metals, as well as free radical quenchers, such as uric acid and bilirubin.\n\nEnzymatic pathways of defense against free radical injury include the superoxide dismutase family of antioxidant enzymes, catalases, GSH peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.¹ Newborns, particularly those born preterm, are at increased risk of oxidative stress because of an immature antioxidant system.¹,²\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\ncholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 cholestasis, it is recommended to reduce supplementation by 50% of the amount typically provided for age, monitor serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin, and adjust supplementation accordingly.54,62 Selenium is critical for antioxidant capacity, primarily through glutathione peroxidase, for immune function, and as a cofactor for thyroid hormone production and regulation; needs may be increased with critical illness and thermal injury.55,63 Selenium deficiency may present as cardiomyopathy (ie, Keshan disease), myalgias, myositis, hemolysis, and impaired cellular immunity.55,63\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Selenium is a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, the enzyme that reduces peroxides and limits oxidative injury; preterm infants have low plasma selenium and reduced glutathione peroxidase activity, so selenium is most likely to reduce oxidative stress via this pathway.\nAnswer: C","parsed_answer":"C","correct":true,"retrieval_context_hash":"05040f409f4506edb6b93cc363d08b4b81e148988c5ade47e7738abd0453e754","retrieval_snapshot_id":"2af3b0bf6a934cce9af9975ce25b0195","latency_ms":4098.548650741577,"tokens_used":0,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":true,"rag_gate_reason":"pass","rag_top_score":0.7301286716563767,"rag_context_chars":6018,"rag_returned_chunks":6,"exact_match":1.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Cue-based feeding\n\nThere are different interventions or feeding strategies that can be used when transitioning a preterm neonate from gastric to oral feedings.¹ If a neonate has clinical instability during feedings, interventions such as cue-based feedings, slow-flow nipples, and pacing may help to establish more stable feedings. For neonates with difficulty latching or maintaining a seal, a nipple shield, proper head support, and proper positioning are helpful. Neonates with a disorganized sucking, swallowing, and breathing sequence may benefit from swaddling to assist with state regulation, cue-based feedings, and pacing. Strategies to assist neonates who have poor endurance during feeding include limiting the length of feedings, providing cue-based feeding, and pacing.\n\n---\n[Source: Questions_from_NeoReviews_A_Study_Guide_for_Neonatal_Perinatal_Medicine.md]\nthe following, the nutrient most likely to reduce oxidative stress through its interaction with the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase is: A.
