Given the current sodium level, additional sodium may not be necessary.\n   - **Potassium:** The potassium level is within the normal range. However, potassium is often added to TPN solutions to meet daily requirements, especially in neonates, to prevent hypokalemia.\n   - **Acetate:** Acetate is often used in TPN to help buffer metabolic acidosis. Given the slightly low bicarbonate level, acetate could be beneficial.\n\n4. **Urine Output:** The urine output is 2.2 mL/kg/hour, which is adequate, suggesting that the kidneys are functioning well to excrete excess electrolytes.\n\nConsidering these points, the infant does not require additional sodium, but potassium and acetate could be beneficial to address the mild metabolic acidosis and maintain potassium levels.\n\n**Answer: C.

Prolonged TPN use in neonates, especially preterm infants, is associated with several complications:\n   - **PN-associated cholestasis and hepatocellular injury (A):** Common in neonates on long-term TPN due to lack of enteral stimulation and prolonged parenteral nutrition.\n   - **Metabolic bone disease and anemia (B):** Can occur due to imbalances in calcium, phosphorus, and trace elements, as well as iron deficiency from lack of enteral feeding.\n   - **Central line–associated bloodstream infections (C):** A significant risk with long-term central venous access required for TPN.\n3. **Short bowel syndrome and \"dumping\" (D):** These are less likely in this context as the infant has not had extensive bowel resection, and \"dumping\" is more related to rapid enteral feeding rather than TPN.\n4. Given the clinical context and the risks associated with prolonged TPN, options A, B, and C are valid concerns.\n\nAnswer: A, B, C","parsed_answer":"A,B,C","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":null,"retrieval_snapshot_id":null,"latency_ms":4539.433717727661,"tokens_used":798,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":false,"rag_gate_reason":"no_snapshot","rag_top_score":0.0,"rag_context_chars":0,"rag_returned_chunks":0,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

The brain's high demand for these fatty acids is due to its role in cognitive function and the need for optimal membrane properties for neurotransmission.

Therefore, this statement is likely true.\n\n- **Option B**: Current guidelines emphasize the importance of advancing enteral nutrition as tolerated to reduce the duration of parenteral nutrition and associated risks. Keeping the umbilical line for 10 days regardless of feeding tolerance is not recommended, as it increases the risk of complications like infection. This statement is false.\n\n- **Option C**: The use of neonate formula is not routinely recommended over breast milk unless there are specific indications (e.g., maternal milk supply issues, specific nutrient deficiencies). Breast milk is preferred for its immunological benefits and digestibility. This statement is not aligned with current best practices.\n\n- **Option D**: Continuous feedings can be beneficial for preterm infants with apnea, as they may reduce the risk of apnea episodes compared to bolus feedings. However, the specific rate of 4 mL/h is not standard and should be individualized based on tolerance and clinical status. This statement is partially true but lacks specificity.\n\n- **Option E**: Feeding via nasogastric tube is standard for preterm infants who cannot feed orally. Alternating nostrils is a common practice to prevent pressure necrosis. This statement is true.\n\nAnswer: A, E","parsed_answer":"A,E","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":null,"retrieval_snapshot_id":null,"latency_ms":9271.433353424072,"tokens_used":999,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":false,"rag_gate_reason":"no_snapshot","rag_top_score":0.0,"rag_context_chars":0,"rag_returned_chunks":0,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

Calcium and phosphorus are critical for bone mineralization, but phosphorus deficiency is often more directly linked to the development of rickets and osteopenia in preterm infants. Vitamin D is also crucial as it facilitates calcium and phosphorus absorption, but the primary mineral deficiency leading to bone disease is phosphorus. Parathyroid hormone and mobility are not primary factors in the development of bone disease of prematurity.\n\nAnswer: D","parsed_answer":"D","correct":false,"retrieval_context_hash":null,"retrieval_snapshot_id":null,"latency_ms":3421.889543533325,"tokens_used":577,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":false,"rag_gate_reason":"no_snapshot","rag_top_score":0.0,"rag_context_chars":0,"rag_returned_chunks":0,"exact_match":0.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other guidelines suggest starting iron supplementation at 2 mg/kg/day at around 2 to 4 weeks of age. This timing is based on the depletion of fetal iron stores and the increased iron requirements for growth and development in preterm infants. Starting too early (at birth) may not be necessary as preterm infants have some iron stores, and starting too late (after 4 weeks) could increase the risk of anemia. Therefore, the best suggested postnatal age for starting iron supplementation is at 2 weeks.\n\nAnswer: B","parsed_answer":"B","correct":true,"retrieval_context_hash":null,"retrieval_snapshot_id":null,"latency_ms":4082.1352005004883,"tokens_used":604,"metrics":{"rag_context_used":false,"rag_gate_reason":"no_snapshot","rag_top_score":0.0,"rag_context_chars":0,"rag_returned_chunks":0,"exact_match":1.0,"partial_match":0.0},"structured_output_used":false,"error":null}
