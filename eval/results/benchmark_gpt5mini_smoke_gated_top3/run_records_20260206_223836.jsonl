Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL.

After the brisk diuresis that usually occurs during the first 3-7 days, urine output generally decreases to about 2-4 mL/kg/h, and fluid intake can be adjusted to about 120-150 mL/kg/d. 7. Once on full enteral nutrition, infants without evidence of CHF or renal dysfunction can almost always tolerated greater intake volumes, e.g., 160-180 mL/kg/d.\n\n---\n[Source: 2018 NICU Guide Full_part2.md]\nlevels in utero that result in pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia.

Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W.

However, until an optimal multitrace element product is developed, one mechanism for dose-adjusting trace elements based on age-specific or disease-specific needs is to supplement PN solutions with copper, selenium, and zinc using the single-entity products instead of the multitrace element products. Thus, accumulation of chromium and manganese can be avoided. For institutions using multitrace element products, supplemental zinc may be required in certain patients, such as preterm infants and those with increased GI losses. In addition, routine monitoring of copper in patients with cholestasis and of chromium and manganese in all patients is advised.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nconditions that require additional zinc intake include elevated urinary zinc excretion (eg, high-output renal failure) and increased GI excretion (eg, high-volume stool loss, fistula/stoma losses). conditions that require additional zinc intake include elevated urinary zinc excretion (eg, high-output renal failure) and increased GI excretion (eg, high-volume stool loss, fistula/stoma losses). conditions that require additional zinc intake include elevated urinary zinc excretion (eg, high-output renal failure) and increased GI excretion (eg, high-volume stool loss, fistula/stoma losses). Parenteral multitrace element products that contain zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium are available (see Table 33-6); single-entity products exist for copper, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc.65,66 Dosing of pediatric multitrace element products is problematic in that the weight-based dosage recommendations underestimate the recommended daily intake for some trace elements such as zinc, while intake is excessive for others like manganese that are contaminants in PN solutions and can accumulate in patients receiving long-term PN support (see Table 33-7).\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: ASPEN guidance notes multitrace products commonly provide excessive manganese and inadequate zinc for neonates, and recommends adding selenium (2 mcg/kg/d) to pediatric PN—commercial multitrace formulations often do not meet that recommendation.

However, until an optimal multitrace element product is developed, one mechanism for dose-adjusting trace elements based on age-specific or disease-specific needs is to supplement PN solutions with copper, selenium, and zinc using the single-entity products instead of the multitrace element products. Thus, accumulation of chromium and manganese can be avoided. For institutions using multitrace element products, supplemental zinc may be required in certain patients, such as preterm infants and those with increased GI losses. In addition, routine monitoring of copper in patients with cholestasis and of chromium and manganese in all patients is advised.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Nutrition_Support_Core_Curriculum_3rd_Edition.md]\nconditions that require additional zinc intake include elevated urinary zinc excretion (eg, high-output renal failure) and increased GI excretion (eg, high-volume stool loss, fistula/stoma losses). conditions that require additional zinc intake include elevated urinary zinc excretion (eg, high-output renal failure) and increased GI excretion (eg, high-volume stool loss, fistula/stoma losses). conditions that require additional zinc intake include elevated urinary zinc excretion (eg, high-output renal failure) and increased GI excretion (eg, high-volume stool loss, fistula/stoma losses). Parenteral multitrace element products that contain zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium are available (see Table 33-6); single-entity products exist for copper, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc.65,66 Dosing of pediatric multitrace element products is problematic in that the weight-based dosage recommendations underestimate the recommended daily intake for some trace elements such as zinc, while intake is excessive for others like manganese that are contaminants in PN solutions and can accumulate in patients receiving long-term PN support (see Table 33-7).\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: ASPEN notes pediatric multitrace products tend to overprovide manganese and underprovide zinc, and recommended adding selenium at 2 mcg/kg/day because older multitrace formulations may not meet selenium recommendations.

In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus.

The first set of laboratory values are obtained at 24 hours of life: Na 138 mEq/L, K 4.2 mEq/L, Cl 108 mEq/L, HCO3 19 mEq/L, glucose 109 mg/dL. The infant's urine output has been 2.2 mL/kg/hour.

Clinicians should refer to the individual laboratory's reference ranges for specific essential fatty acids when assessing for EFAD.29 ## Micronutrients\n ### Electrolytes\n\nClose monitoring of electrolyte status is essential. In newborns, the addition of electrolytes to PN may be deferred until the second day of life in some cases. Potassium is generally added once normal kidney status and good urine output are established, and sodium is often added once diuresis begins. In infants at risk for refeeding syndrome, phosphorus may be added on the first day of PN, but the salt form needs to be considered as it is available as both a sodium and potassium salt. Daily adjustments to electrolyte intake are often necessary. The electrolyte requirements of preterm and term infants are generally similar, except for calcium and phosphorus. Prescribing electrolytes as the amount per kilogram per day is recommended in pediatric patients (see Table 33-4).\n\n---\n[Source: UCSF Neonatal TPN.md]\n(DOL, day of life; pulm., pulmonary; PPHN, persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn; MAS meconium aspiration syndrome) 4. **Electrolyte requirements** are stated on the parenteral nutrition order form and must be adjusted according to serum values and clinical condition. (See section of Fluids and Electrolytes, p. 56) Initial PN solutions may be started without added electrolytes. Add electrolytes gradually as the patient becomes more stable. Acetate is metabolized to HCO3- and is added to adjust acid-base status. It can be ordered maximize, minimize, or balance with chloride depending upon an infant's acid-base status.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Electrolytes may be deferred until day 2, but this infant has good urine output (2.2 mL/kg/hr) and established renal function, so both sodium and potassium should be added.

To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth.

This practice has largely been abandoned because of the lack of evidence to support it and the benefits documented with early initiation of amino acids in premature infants (ie, ≥2–2.5 g/kg/d within a few hours after birth).23,24\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nnitrogen balance.

Specially formulated amino acid blends may be extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease). To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth. Infants only provided dextrose-containing fluids would continue to break down muscle mass that is difficult to regain.

PN supplementation is recommended for children who are unable to receive any EN during the first week in the PICU. For patients with severe malnutrition or who are at risk of nutrition deterioration, PN may be supplemented in the first week if they are unable to advance past low volumes of EN.2 The timing of PN initiation should be individualized.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Statement A is incorrect — fetal metabolic and growth rates do not cease at birth, and preterm/low-birth-weight infants have low nutrient stores and high needs, so routine early IV nutrition (PN) is indicated rather than precluded.
