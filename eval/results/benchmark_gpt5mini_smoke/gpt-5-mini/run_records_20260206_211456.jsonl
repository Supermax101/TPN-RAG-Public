E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings.

Calcium and phosphorus solubility is enhanced by an acidic solution pH and decreased solution temperature. Solution pH is decreased by using pediatric amino acid products, the addition of cysteine, and higher amino acid and dextrose concentrations. Calcium gluconate is the preferred salt for use in PN solutions since it is more stable and disassociates less rapidly than calcium chloride. While visual assessment of the solution will detect macroprecipitates, calcium phosphate microprecipitates can form that cannot be seen by the naked eye. To prevent potentially fatal pulmonary emboli from a systemic infusion of calcium phosphate precipitates, the recommendation is to calculate the amount of calcium and phosphate in PN solutions, utilize solubility checks during compounding, and filter PN solutions with a 1.2-micron filter during administration.43 In addition, the use of TNAs is not recommended in neonates and infants.29\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: Current Ca is 3.5 mEq/kg (matches recommended neonatal Ca), but phosphate at 3 mEq/kg is higher than the commonly recommended ~1.4 mmol/kg for a preterm neonate, yielding a Ca:P ratio well below the neonatal target (≈2:1–2.5:1).

Maintenance fluid requirements can be assessed by using the Holliday-Segar method (see Table 4-5 in chapter 4, \"Infant to Adolescent\").[28] Fluid requirements can be higher when there are increased insensible losses (fever or tachypnea) or sensible losses (diarrhea, nasogastric [NG] output, ostomy losses, polyuria, or vomiting). In certain clinical situations, such as cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction, fluids may need to be restricted. Fluid needs will vary with a variety of clinical and environmental conditions (Table 7-10). Therefore, routine clinical monitoring of hydration status, including electrolytes and intakes and outputs, is essential for neonates receiving PN. Table 7-11 lists the estimated electrolyte losses and typical replacement fluids used in various GI losses; however, precise quantification is possible by sending a specimen to the chemistry laboratory for measurement of electrolyte concentrations.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nto not exceed this infusion rate and reevaluate the rate with each dose change or when cycling the PN to ensure that the infusion rate remains near or below the adult maximum. --- <!-- Page 185 --> to not exceed this infusion rate and reevaluate the rate with each dose change or when cycling the PN to ensure that the infusion rate remains near or below the adult maximum. --- <!-- Page 185 --> # Micronutrients: Electrolytes Electrolytes play a large role in many physiologic functions and are added to PN solutions to maintain appropriate concentrations when the patient is unable to meet their needs enterally. The function of electrolytes is elaborated next$^{24,25}$: - Sodium is the main cation in the extracellular fluid and is responsible for maintaining intravascular and interstitial fluid volumes and also supports growth and weight gain$^{48}$. - Potassium is the major intracellular cation and is responsible for neuromuscular function and protein/glycogen synthesis. - Chloride and acetate are the 2 main anions that are responsible for acid/base balance and osmotic pressure. Typically, the dose of sodium in the PN is matched to the dose of chloride with the rest added as acetate. These 2 anions can be manipulated in the PN as acid/base status changes. One needs to be cautious when using only chloride or acetate in the PN as this could cause large shifts in acid–base balance.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: The infant has adequate urine output (2.2 mL/kg/hr), so potassium can be started at a low maintenance dose; serum K is normal.

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings. Thus, for patients whose feedings are changing or at high risk for feeding intolerance, it may be better not to include the feeds in the daily PN order.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\n10] + [(sodium + potassium + calcium + magnesium mEq/L) × 2] = approximate mOsm/L mEq/L TABLE 7-9.

Maintenance fluid requirements can be assessed by using the Holliday-Segar method (see Table 4-5 in chapter 4, \"Infant to Adolescent\").[28] Fluid requirements can be higher when there are increased insensible losses (fever or tachypnea) or sensible losses (diarrhea, nasogastric [NG] output, ostomy losses, polyuria, or vomiting). In certain clinical situations, such as cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction, fluids may need to be restricted. Fluid needs will vary with a variety of clinical and environmental conditions (Table 7-10). Therefore, routine clinical monitoring of hydration status, including electrolytes and intakes and outputs, is essential for neonates receiving PN. Table 7-11 lists the estimated electrolyte losses and typical replacement fluids used in various GI losses; however, precise quantification is possible by sending a specimen to the chemistry laboratory for measurement of electrolyte concentrations.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Pediatric_Neonatal_Nutrition_Handbook_3rd_Edition.md]\nto not exceed this infusion rate and reevaluate the rate with each dose change or when cycling the PN to ensure that the infusion rate remains near or below the adult maximum. --- <!-- Page 185 --> to not exceed this infusion rate and reevaluate the rate with each dose change or when cycling the PN to ensure that the infusion rate remains near or below the adult maximum. --- <!-- Page 185 --> # Micronutrients: Electrolytes Electrolytes play a large role in many physiologic functions and are added to PN solutions to maintain appropriate concentrations when the patient is unable to meet their needs enterally. The function of electrolytes is elaborated next$^{24,25}$: - Sodium is the main cation in the extracellular fluid and is responsible for maintaining intravascular and interstitial fluid volumes and also supports growth and weight gain$^{48}$. - Potassium is the major intracellular cation and is responsible for neuromuscular function and protein/glycogen synthesis. - Chloride and acetate are the 2 main anions that are responsible for acid/base balance and osmotic pressure. Typically, the dose of sodium in the PN is matched to the dose of chloride with the rest added as acetate. These 2 anions can be manipulated in the PN as acid/base status changes. One needs to be cautious when using only chloride or acetate in the PN as this could cause large shifts in acid–base balance.\n\nOutput format (follow EXACTLY):\nReasoning: <brief reasoning>\nAnswer: <ONLY the letter(s), e.g. A or A, C, D — nothing else>","response_text":"Reasoning: At 24 h the infant has adequate urine output (2.2 mL/kg/hr) and normal serum Na (138 mEq/L) and K (4.2 mEq/L), but a low HCO3 (19) suggesting mild metabolic acidosis.

Maintenance fluid requirements can be assessed by using the Holliday-Segar method (see Table 4-5 in chapter 4, \"Infant to Adolescent\").[28] Fluid requirements can be higher when there are increased insensible losses (fever or tachypnea) or sensible losses (diarrhea, nasogastric [NG] output, ostomy losses, polyuria, or vomiting). In certain clinical situations, such as cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction, fluids may need to be restricted. Fluid needs will vary with a variety of clinical and environmental conditions (Table 7-10). Therefore, routine clinical monitoring of hydration status, including electrolytes and intakes and outputs, is essential for neonates receiving PN.

Please check catheter placement and verify with your attending that the line can be considered \"central\". The differentiation is important, since the concentrations of various key elements of parenteral nutrition (e.g., dextrose, calcium) that can be infused safely are greater in central vs. peripheral vessels.

Catheters ending in a large vessel (inferior/superior vena cava or aorta) are considered central regardless of type (Broviac, Cook, UAC, UVC, mini silastic \"PICC\" line). Please check catheter placement and verify with your attending that the line can be considered \"central\". The differentiation is important, since the concentrations of various key elements of parenteral nutrition (e.g., dextrose, calcium) that can be infused safely are greater in central vs. peripheral vessels. By indicating the catheter site, the Pharmacy can help assure that safe concentration limits are NOT exceeded.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\nPN administration. --- <!-- Page 50 --> Table 3-1.

Fat**: Intravenous lipid emulsions are essential components of TPN. They provide essential fatty acids and are a concentrated energy source critical for growth and development of infants not receiving enteral feedings. There are potential safety concerns regarding administration of lipid emulsions to very low birth weight infants and infants with hyperbilirubinemia, pulmonary hypertension and serious pulmonary disease. To maximize benefits of lipids and minimize their adverse effects, use the following guidelines: (a) provide sufficient lipids to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency; (b) monitor for evidence of lipid intolerance; (c) adjust lipid dose based on clinical status.\n\n---\n[Source: ASPEN_Parenteral_Nutrition_Handbook_Third_Edition.md]\nThese products have been shown to be protein-sparing and have been reported to induce less insulin response than dextrose-based regimens, although another study found the opposite to be true.²⁻⁴ These products have been shown to be protein-sparing and have been reported to induce less insulin response than dextrose-based regimens, although another study found the opposite to be true.²⁻⁴ These products have been shown to be protein-sparing and have been reported to induce less insulin response than dextrose-based regimens, although another study found the opposite to be true.²⁻⁴ Lipids.

To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth.

To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4 g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving \"starter PN.\" For term neonates, dosing begins as 2–3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5–3 g/kg/d (Table 7-13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5 g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1 g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.[30] To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth.
