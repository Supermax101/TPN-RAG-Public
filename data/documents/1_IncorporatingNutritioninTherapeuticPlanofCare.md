# NUTRITION SCREENING

Don't lose the tree for the forest...
* Effective screening depends on recognition of the link between nutrition and poor clinical outcomes: Education is essential
* Typically located within the Nursing Admission History, which also includes screening for MRSA, pain, as well as risk for falls, pressure injury, and suicide
  * (EHR placement of information could be institution specific)
* Opportunity for nurses to initiate interdisciplinary collaboration - available to all

NUTRITION ASSESSMENT

- Cornerstone of the nutrition care process:
  - Performed by nutrition clinician
  - Documents the nutritional diagnosis, including severity of malnutrition
  - Establishes a plan for nutrition care
  - Specifies appropriate nutritional interventions, as indicated
  - Highlights priorities for primary healthcare provider
  - Outlines monitoring parameters and evaluation criteria
- Informs all aspects of the overall therapeutic plan by identifying need for additional interdisciplinary collaboration, e. g., pharmacy, speech therapy, physical therapy, etc.
