## Section 4: TPN Solution (Pharmacy Compounding Recipe)

> *Below is the recipe for the compounded TPN solution that is prepared by pharmacy.*
> *The solution should deliver the doses above if running at the ordered rate (mL/hr) and duration.*
> *Note: We use 2-in-1 TPN instead of 3-in-1 TPN at LPCH (lipids are in separate bag from other components).*

| TPN Solution (including 30% overfill) | mL |
|---------------------------------------|:----:|
| AA 10% volume (mL) | 24.18 |
| Dextrose 70% (mL) | 9.2 |
| NaCl (4 mEq/mL) | 0.29 |
| KCl (2 mEq/mL) | 0.58 |
| KPO4 (4.4 mEq K + 3mM PO4 per mL) | 0.00 |
| K Acetate (2 mEq/mL) | -1.16 |
| Na Acetate | 0 |
| Selenium (60 mcg/mL) | 0 |
| Famotidine (10 mg/mL) | 0.00 |
| Zinc (1000 mcg/mL) | 0.00 |
| Magnesium (1 mEq/mL) | 0.00 |
| Calcium gluconate (100 mg/mL) | 0 |
| Copper (400 mcg/mL) | 0.00 |
| Pedi mVI | 0.0 |
| Water for Q.S | 31 |
| **Total TPN bag volume** | **64** |

> *Nurses need overfill for priming the lines*

> *<= Can have different combination of these depending on how the compounder is set up for priority of additives (only an example)*

## Section 5: Common Limitations for Additives

> *Usually different PIV and central line max*

| Parameter | Value | Limitation Description |
|-----------|:-----:|----------------------|
| AA% | 27.2 | AA concentration (%) max |
| Calcium gluconate (g/L) | 0 | Calcium-phosphate solubility curve and/or max calcium dose |
| Phosphate (mM/L) | 0.0 | Calcium-phosphate solubility curve and/or max calcium dose |
| Magnesium (mEq/L) | 0.0 | Max concentrations of electrolytes |
| Potassium (mEq/L) | 0 | K or Na available for providing acetate, phosphate, and chloride |
| Sodium (mEq/L) | 0 | Osmolarity max |

## Key Notes

1. **2-in-1 TPN System**: LPCH uses 2-in-1 TPN (lipids in a separate bag from other components), NOT 3-in-1
2. **30% Overfill**: TPN bag includes 30% overfill volume for line priming
3. **GIR**: Glucose infusion rate for this patient = 5.05 mg/kg/min
4. **Patient**: 0.62 kg neonate, 80 mL/kg/day total fluids, 3 g/kg/day amino acids, 10% dextrose
5. **Acetate Buffer**: Trophamine itself contributes acetate (~1 mEq/kg buffer), which is accounted for in the acetate calculation (negative value means AA already provides sufficient buffer)
6. **Potassium Safety**: Max potassium infusion rate = 0.5 mEq/kg/hr
