As secondary objectives, the study will determine if milrinone improves oxygenation at 48 and 72 hours post-infusion, reduces right ventricular pressures on echocardiogram, and alters the risk of systemic hypotension, arrhythmias, intracranial hemorrhage, need for ECMO, and chronic lung disease. Screening for this study is expected to open in early 2018.

Language problems in preterm children are thought to be related to neurobiological factors, including injuries to white matter structures of the brain and environmental factors, including decreased exposure to maternal speech in the hospital nursery. To help minimize these problems, the present research aims to demonstrate that a language intervention, which involves playing recordings of a mother's voice to the infant while s/he is in the hospital nursery, will be effective for promoting healthy brain and language development in preterm babies.

These NIRS measures will then be correlated with mortality and significant CNS morbidities including intraventricular hemorrhage and white matter injury as determined by cranial ultrasound and MRI. NIRS monitoring has the potential for identifying preterm infants at highest risk for death or neurologic injury.\n\n<a id='39518b3c-f1a4-4521-aab9-f6770bfb4d3c'></a>\n\n**Bilirubin binding capacity**\n\nVinod K. Bhutani, MD, David Stevenson, MD and Angelo Lamola, PhD\n\n<a id='56168c47-12ce-4938-81d3-4fdc95408547'></a>\n\nBBC defines the dynamic relationship between an infant's level of unbound or \"free\" bilirubin and his/her ability to \"tolerate\" increasing bilirubin loads. BBC is not synonymous with albumin levels because albumin binding of bilirubin is confounded by a variety of molecular, biologic, and metabolic factors. We have finalized a novel modification of a previously developed hematofluorometric method to directly assay BBC in whole blood from preterm and term neonates. Our data suggests that individualized BBC assays would provide a robust approach to gauge risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity compared with total bilirubin and gestational age to guide individualized thresholds for intervention.

Point-of-care screening could provide benefits but as of yet there is not a single point-of-care newborn screening technology available for biochemical screening. We are developing a point-of-care platform using a miniature version of digital microfluidic technology for the immediate detection and diagnosis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with measurements for total serum bilirubin, G6PD, albumin, carboxyhemoglobin, and bilirubin binding capacity.

We propose that altered neurologic development in preterm and small for gestational age infants is related to an incomplete or failed transition of consciousness after birth, resulting in disturbances of self-regulation of breathing, maintenance of body temperature, breast feeding behavior, maternal recognition, and ultimately in abnormal neurologic development.\n(Gates Foundation)\n\n<a id='5da7d946-3114-4feb-83e4-014eec75bc28'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

The Eldon card system provides immediate point-of-care determination of Rh blood group which could be applicable not only in hospital but also in community settings and homes. This uses a single drop of capillary blood, an Eldon card and produces a result in two minutes.

BBC is not synonymous with albumin levels because albumin binding of bilirubin is confounded by a variety of molecular, biologic, and metabolic factors. We have finalized a novel modification of a previously developed hematofluorometric method to directly assay BBC in whole blood from preterm and term neonates. Our data suggests that individualized BBC assays would provide a robust approach to gauge risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity compared with total bilirubin and gestational age to guide individualized thresholds for intervention.

Point-of-care screening could provide benefits but as of yet there is not a single point-of-care newborn screening technology available for biochemical screening. We are developing a point-of-care platform using a miniature version of digital microfluidic technology for the immediate detection and diagnosis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with measurements for total serum bilirubin, G6PD, albumin, carboxyhemoglobin, and bilirubin binding capacity.

We propose that altered neurologic development in preterm and small for gestational age infants is related to an incomplete or failed transition of consciousness after birth, resulting in disturbances of self-regulation of breathing, maintenance of body temperature, breast feeding behavior, maternal recognition, and ultimately in abnormal neurologic development.\n(Gates Foundation)",

The Eldon card system provides immediate point-of-care determination of Rh blood group which could be applicable not only in hospital but also in community settings and homes. This uses a single drop of capillary blood, an Eldon card and produces a result in two minutes. A study of Eldon card blood group determination of women in the antenatal clinics and postpartum will be undertaken comparing the results of the Eldon card to the \"gold standard\" of a blood test in an immunohematology laboratory.\n(Packard Foundation)",

Alternatively, the consent and HIPAA authorization can be faxed to the unit where the child is and the transport team can be asked to bring the signed documents back. Whichever method is used, the neonatologist, fellow or research team member should conduct the full informed consent process with the family over the telephone.",

As secondary objectives, the study will determine if milrinone improves oxygenation at 48 and 72 hours post-infusion, reduces right ventricular pressures on echocardiogram, and alters the risk of systemic hypotension, arrhythmias, intracranial hemorrhage, need for ECMO, and chronic lung disease. Screening for this study is expected to open in early 2018.

Language problems in preterm children are thought to be related to neurobiological factors, including injuries to white matter structures of the brain and environmental factors, including decreased exposure to maternal speech in the hospital nursery. To help minimize these problems, the present research aims to demonstrate that a language intervention, which involves playing recordings of a mother's voice to the infant while s/he is in the hospital nursery, will be effective for promoting healthy brain and language development in preterm babies.

These NIRS measures will then be correlated with mortality and significant CNS morbidities including intraventricular hemorrhage and white matter injury as determined by cranial ultrasound and MRI. NIRS monitoring has the potential for identifying preterm infants at highest risk for death or neurologic injury.\n\n<a id='39518b3c-f1a4-4521-aab9-f6770bfb4d3c'></a>\n\n**Bilirubin binding capacity**\n\nVinod K. Bhutani, MD, David Stevenson, MD and Angelo Lamola, PhD\n\n<a id='56168c47-12ce-4938-81d3-4fdc95408547'></a>\n\nBBC defines the dynamic relationship between an infant's level of unbound or \"free\" bilirubin and his/her ability to \"tolerate\" increasing bilirubin loads. BBC is not synonymous with albumin levels because albumin binding of bilirubin is confounded by a variety of molecular, biologic, and metabolic factors. We have finalized a novel modification of a previously developed hematofluorometric method to directly assay BBC in whole blood from preterm and term neonates. Our data suggests that individualized BBC assays would provide a robust approach to gauge risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity compared with total bilirubin and gestational age to guide individualized thresholds for intervention.

Point-of-care screening could provide benefits but as of yet there is not a single point-of-care newborn screening technology available for biochemical screening. We are developing a point-of-care platform using a miniature version of digital microfluidic technology for the immediate detection and diagnosis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with measurements for total serum bilirubin, G6PD, albumin, carboxyhemoglobin, and bilirubin binding capacity.

We propose that altered neurologic development in preterm and small for gestational age infants is related to an incomplete or failed transition of consciousness after birth, resulting in disturbances of self-regulation of breathing, maintenance of body temperature, breast feeding behavior, maternal recognition, and ultimately in abnormal neurologic development.\n(Gates Foundation)\n\n<a id='5da7d946-3114-4feb-83e4-014eec75bc28'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

The Eldon card system provides immediate point-of-care determination of Rh blood group which could be applicable not only in hospital but also in community settings and homes. This uses a single drop of capillary blood, an Eldon card and produces a result in two minutes.
