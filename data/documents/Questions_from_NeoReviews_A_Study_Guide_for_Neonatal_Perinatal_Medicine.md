# Preface

Since 2007, *NeoReviews™*, an online neonatology journal from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), has published 4 to 10 continuing medical education questions per monthly issue. These questions refer to content from a review article and allow readers to assess their knowledge of the key aspects of the review. For this book, we selected approximately 1,200 questions that were published between 2007 and 2017 and remain relevant today. For each question, there is a short explanation of the correct answer with references, including the original article.

We envision that this book will be particularly helpful for neonatology fellows who are studying for the neonatal-perinatal medicine board examination, as the content closely correlates with the American Board of Pediatrics content specifications. It may also serve as a refresher and introduction to new topics for practicing neonatologists. In addition, we believe that this book is a valuable self-learning tool for pediatric residents, neonatal nurse practitioners, and neonatal nurses.

The *NeoReviews* Editorial Board aims to create a mix of content that encompasses core topics in neonatology as well as topics at the cutting edge of our field. To that end, some of the questions reference areas where knowledge is rapidly evolving; if readers find a question and answer that may be outdated, we encourage them to contact us so that we can update future editions.

We would like to acknowledge 2 people who crafted most of the original questions: Jayant Shenai, MD, FAAP, and Henry C. Lee, MD, FAAP, coauthor of this manual. We would also like to thank several people at the AAP who helped us get this book published: Carrie Peters, editor, professional/clinical publishing; Barrett Winston, senior manager, publishing acquisitions and business development; Jeff Mahony, director, professional and consumer publishing; and Joe Puskarz, director, journal publishing. We also thank Luann Zanzola and Sara Weissenborn, the past and current managing editors of *NeoReviews*.

Finally, we would like to dedicate this book to Alistair Philip, MD, FAAP, the editor in chief of *NeoReviews* from 2006 to 2017, who has been a wonderful editor, mentor, and friend; the field of neonatology has benefited tremendously from all his contributions.

PART 1: QUESTIONS

# CARDIOLOGY

1. Differential cyanosis is defined as a difference in oxygen saturation of at least 5% or a difference in partial pressure of oxygen (Pao₂) of at least 20 mm Hg between the arm and the leg. If the upper extremity oxygen measurement is lower than the lower extremity oxygen measurement, the term reverse differential cyanosis is used. Of the following, the congenital heart disease most often associated with reverse differential cyanosis is:

A. Dextro-transposition of great arteries with coarctation of aorta or pulmonary hypertension
B. Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve
C. Tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve
D. Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection
E. Truncus arteriosus

2. In newborns who have single-ventricle physiology, the proportions of venous return depend on how much blood flows to the pulmonary circulation through the ductus arteriosus compared with that entering the systemic circulation through the aorta. Ideally, the pulmonary blood flow (Qp) and systemic blood flow (Qs) should be balanced, leading to a Qp:Qs ratio of 1.0 to 1.7, which corresponds to an arterial oxygen saturation (Sao₂) of 75% to 85%. If the Sao₂ remains unacceptably high (&gt;90%), therapeutic measures to increase pulmonary vascular resistance and lower systemic vascular resistance are warranted. Of the following, the therapeutic measure most likely to improve systemic blood flow in newborns who have single-ventricle physiology is administration of:

A. Arginine-vasopressin
B. High-dose dopamine
C. Phosphodiesterase III inhibitor milrinone
D. Sodium bicarbonate
E. Supplemental oxygen

3. The classic phenotype of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) includes left ventricular hypoplasia associated with mitral stenosis/atresia, aortic atresia, coarctation of aorta, and an intact ventricular septum. Of the following, the most accurate statement regarding HLHS is that:

A. An intact interatrial septum is critical for survival.
B. Functional status of the right ventricle determines the approach to palliation.
C. HLHS accounts for approximately 25% of all cases of congenital heart disease.
D. Left ventricular communication with coronary sinusoids worsens the prognosis.
E. The size of the descending aorta is a risk factor for surgical palliation.

4. You are asked to evaluate a 4-day-old term newborn for a cardiac arrhythmia. You review with medical students the normal findings on neonatal electrocardiography (ECG). Of the following, the most accurate statement regarding normal ECG findings in such a neonate is that the:

A. Corrected QT interval averages 470 ms
B. PR interval is measured best in lead I
C. QRS axis ranges from +55° to +200°
D. QRS duration ranges from 70 to 140 ms
E. T wave is usually negative in lead V₁

Questions

5. The transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life presents an abrupt change in cardiac workload and myocardial substrate delivery. The former is characterized by a decrease in right ventricular workload because of a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and by an increase in left ventricular workload because of an increase in systemic vascular resistance. The latter is characterized by a shift in myocardial substrate delivery from the fetal to the adult pattern. Of the following, the primary myocardial substrate used by the adult heart is:

A. Amino acids
B. Fatty acids
C. Glucose
D. Glycogen

6. The term *hypotension* can be defined simply as an abnormally low blood pressure. However, the definition of hypotension in neonates is compounded by uncertainties in establishing the lower limit of normal blood pressure below which treatment is required. Of the following, the most common approach to defining hypotension in neonates is based on:

8. When a newborn fails to achieve or sustain the normal decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance at birth, the result is hypoxemic respiratory failure or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Of the following, the mediator most responsible for normal pulmonary vascular transition at birth is:

A. Asymmetric dimethylarginine
B. Endothelin-1
C. Leukotriene
D. Nitric oxide
E. Thromboxane

B. Neonates with HLHS are most likely to have deficits of motor development, with 90% of patients having normal cognitive outcomes at school age but with 30% to 40% having motor difficulties.
C. Neurologic imaging is unlikely to be of use in this case because 99% of patients with HLHS have normal brain ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings.
D. Several large studies concerning neonates with HLHS have demonstrated no differences in neurodevelopmental or medical outcomes whether the condition was diagnosed prenatally or after profound circulatory collapse after postnatal ductal closure.
E. The presence of a genetic polymorphism of apolipoprotein E in neonates with HLHS is a neuroprotective factor.

A. α- and β-adrenergic agonists are the most effective antihypertensive drugs in preterm neonates.
B. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be avoided in preterm neonates, those with acute renal failure, and those with hyperkalemia.
C. In observational studies, preterm neonates who receive antihypertensive medications in the initial neonatal intensive care unit hospital course have a strong likelihood (&gt;50%) of requiring lifelong antihypertensive therapy.
D. Nephrogenesis stops at approximately 24-weeks' gestational age, so subsequent postnatal therapies will have little clinical benefit in this population.
E. There is no indication or role for oral antihypertensive medications in the neonatal intensive care unit.

23. A newborn with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) undergoes brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery. Which of the following is correct regarding imaging for congenital heart disease (CHD)?

A. Normal brain MRI results are highly specific for long-term development in CHD regardless of type, and follow-up evaluations of neurodevelopment for such patients are not necessary.
B. Approximately 75% to 90% of newborns with CHD demonstrate white matter injury on MRI or on autopsy postoperatively.
C. Brain MRI is more sensitive than ultrasonography for intraventricular hemorrhage but is overall less likely to detect infarction, periventricular leukomalacia, or evidence of hypoxia-ischemia.
D. In general, the use of brain MRI for d-TGA should be restricted to several weeks postoperatively and closer to the time of discharge because there are unlikely to be significant differences in pre- or postsurgical imaging results.
E. The most common abnormalities detected on presurgical MRI for patients with complex CHD are white matter injury and infarction.

Of the following, the most accurate statement regarding cerebral autoregulation in neonates is that:

A. Autoregulation in the human fetus develops much later in gestation than it does in the fetal lamb.
B. Autoregulation is active in preterm neonates treated with dopamine for systemic arterial hypotension.

The postnatal age at the time of blood sampling, therefore, is important in assessment of thyroid function in the newborn. Of the following, the optimal postnatal age to determine baseline thyroid function in the newborn is:

A. 6 hours
B. 12 hours
C. 18 hours
D. 24 hours

9. You are told that a newborn has been followed up with several glucose tests for hypoglycemia because of symptoms of jitteriness. You are reviewing the medical record for possible risk factors. Which of the following statements regarding metabolic risk factors is correct?

A. Newborns with intrauterine growth restriction are at risk for a longer and deeper decrease in glucose levels, as well as decreased ability to achieve an adequate metabolic response to hypoglycemia.

B. One of the main challenges that a newborn faces is that the neonatal brain is unable to use alternative fuels such as ketones and lactate, so even a short period of low glucose levels can lead to long-term brain injury.

C. Serum glucose levels can be misleading after birth because there is a rapid increase in gluconeogenesis in the first 6 hours, leading to decreased glucose levels in the serum but sufficient energy substrates in vital organs.

D. The most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in the newborn period is remnants of maternally injected insulin for diabetes that has crossed the placenta.

E. Although preterm birth is associated with poor growth, hypoglycemia is very rare in the first several hours after birth because there are sufficient mechanisms for maternal transfer and neonatal adaptation.

B. Hydrocortisone downregulates cardiovascular adrenergic receptors by inhibiting gene expression in adrenal cells.

C. One mechanism of action of corticosteroids is through the inhibition of catecholamine metabolism, blocking reuptake of circulating catecholamines.

D. Several studies have demonstrated that hydrocortisone administration leads to a consistent decrease in total cortisol concentration in patients.

E. The primary mechanism of hydrocortisone affecting blood pressure in preterm neonates is via direct stimulation of the hypothalamus as a corticotropin-releasing hormone agonist.

19. You are called to evaluate a female newborn who was born at 39-weeks' gestational age and is now 30 minutes old. Although the reason for the test is unclear, a bedside reagent strip test has been completed and indicates a blood glucose level of 50 mg/dL. The newborn is crying vigorously and otherwise appears well. Which of the following statements regarding glucose testing and metabolic changes occurring in this newborn is correct?

A. Although the newborn appears well, the glucose level noted is low for this age, and this finding alone indicates a high likelihood of potential brain injury.
B. During the time after birth, enzymes for glycogenolysis and ketogenesis will be switching on to facilitate glucose release and production of ketone bodies, respectively.
C. In newborns of mothers who do not have diabetes or hyperinsulinemic states, blood glucose levels increase uniformly and steadily for the first 2 to 4 hours after birth, allowing for establishment of feedings and eventual glucose balance.
D. This low level largely is due to the normal rapid and large neonatal insulin release that occurs shortly after birth until approximately 6 hours of age, along with a simultaneous decrease in catecholamine release.
E. This patient's liver function should be watched closely because the liver is an obligate glucose user, whereas organs such as the kidneys and brain burn fatty fuels for energy.

23. A pregnant woman has been clinically thyrotoxic and has been receiving pharmacologic therapy. Her neonate is delivered via cesarean section at 40-weeks' gestational age because of breech presentation. Which of the following steps are appropriate for treatment of this neonate? Cord blood should be sent to test for free thyroxine as the main tool for evaluation of neonatal thyroid status.If the neonate's thyrotropin receptor antibody is greater than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, it is recommended that the neonate is kept under close observation for the first few days after birth, with particular attention paid to the heart rate and blood pressure.If the maternal thyrotropin receptor antibody has been negative, neonatal treatment with iodine should begin within the first hour while awaiting pending laboratory test results.To prevent false-positive results, laboratory testing in the neonate should be delayed for 1 to 2 weeks because serum levels of antibodies and thyroid function will primarily reflect placental passage of maternal hormones and antibodies.Regardless of the maternal history, thyroid function studies should be performed only if the neonate displays symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, such as dysrhythmia or poor feeding.

25. A 39-weeks' gestational age male is born via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a woman who had gestational diabetes that was controlled with diet. He develops respiratory distress, and an evaluation includes a hematocrit measurement of 72% 2 hours after birth. Which of the following statements regarding this clinical circumstance is correct? A hematocrit measurement at 2 hours' postnatal age is more reflective of the mother's hematocrit level and should not be considered as part of the diagnostic workup of a neonate.Erythropoietin would have been rapidly consumed by this fetus, and if an amniotic fluid sample had been obtained before delivery, it is likely that erythropoietin levels in the fluid would be low or nonexistent.This neonate may have had some degree of chronic hypoxemia and increased erythropoietin synthesis to increase oxygen-carrying capacity.This neonate's ferritin levels are likely to be abnormally elevated.Although polycythemia can occur in type 1 diabetic pregnancies, it is not associated with gestational diabetes and is likely to arise from a different cause in this scenario.

34. A parent of a preterm neonate has heard about the importance of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for brain development and asks whether her child is receiving enough of that fatty acid. The neonate is currently receiving only parenteral nutrition, while feedings are being held for possible necrotizing enterocolitis. Which of the following statements is correct regarding specific fatty acids for preterm neonates?

A. Even if the patient had been receiving enteral feedings, the main source of DHA would still be intravenous solution, because the bioavailability of DHA in breast milk feedings is very low, with absorption rates of less than 20%.

B. Intralipid provides large amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs); however, there are minimal amounts of linoleic acid (LA), which necessitates early enteral feedings to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency.

C. The current intravenous and enteral nutritional approaches in preterm neonates are unable to achieve intrauterine accretion rates of LCPUFAs.

D. When there is a deficit of DHA in the postnatal period, nutritional interventions such as intravenous or oral supplementation can generally bring levels back to intrauterine levels within a few days of therapy, even after prolonged deficiency.

E. Within the first postnatal week, LA levels typically decrease by 50% in preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit, whereas DHA levels generally remain stable.

16. You are counseling a mother of a 10-day-old 24-weeks' gestational age male who has had a severe clinical deterioration, including bloody stools. You suspect that he may have necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The patient is involved in a research protocol, and several tests have been performed; which of the following test results and matching conclusion is appropriate?

A. Although the patient presents with bloody stools and distended abdomen, the citrulline level is normal; because this test has excellent accuracy in the early phase of disease, you can tell the mother that her son does not have NEC.
B. Levels of the complement activation product, C5a, are low; this may indicate excessive complement consumption and increases your suspicion for NEC.
C. The patient's platelet-activating factor level is abnormally low; you conclude that NEC may be playing a part in platelet consumption and that this patient is likely to have NEC.
D. The urinary claudin-3 level is lower than normal range; this is likely due to apoptosis in the intestinal mucosa and, although not 100% sensitive, suggests either NEC or severe infection.
E. The urinary intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) level is 5 times higher than the high-range value of 2.20 pg/nmol of creatinine; because I-FABP levels may indicate disease severity, this increases your suspicion that this neonate may have severe NEC and leads you to pursue follow-up tests and treatment.

21. You are caring for a 1-day-old, 28-weeks' gestational age female who has respiratory distress syndrome that is improving, and you are considering starting feedings in the next day or two. You approach the mother to discuss feeding type, and she indicates that she plans to provide infant formula only. Which of the following is true regarding human milk and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)?

A. Because there are several biologically plausible mechanisms for human milk's role in the prevention of NEC, such as antigen-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins, as well as multiple observational studies demonstrating a protective effect compared with the effects of infant formula, mother's own milk is the preferred feeding choice for this neonate.

B. Donor milk and mother's own milk have the same composition of bioactive factors and have equivalent protective effect on NEC; therefore, this mother should not be encouraged to pump during the hospitalization if donor milk is available.

C. Human milk may have an even more protective effect if pasteurized to eliminate potential pathogenic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium.

D. Infant formula appears to have an all-or-none effect on NEC risk; therefore, if any infant formula is going to be used at all, there will be no benefit of human milk.

E. There are various epidemiologic studies regarding the relationship between human milk and NEC, and results are inconclusive because approximately one-half the studies show a benefit to infant formula for prevention of NEC.

B. Enteral feedings should be started at 40-weeks' gestational age or later because feedings will not be tolerated until that time and parenteral nutrition will supply adequate calories.

C. In most cases of gastroschisis, definitive closure leads to active bowel function, and a neonate at this age should be able to feed ad lib without other nutrition supplementation in the next 2 to 3 days.

D. Before any feedings, a small bowel contrast study should be performed to assess for patency of the intestines.

E. Trophic enteral feedings can be started when gastric output via the orogastric tube decreases.

The parents ask you to explain the procedure in more detail. Which of the following is true regarding primary peritoneal drainage for necrotizing enterocolitis?

A. On the basis of reviewing data derived from randomized clinical trials, no significant benefits or harms of peritoneal drainage versus laparotomy have been identified; further clinical trials may help to reveal the optimal therapy.

B. It is most often used as a therapy for medical necrotizing enterocolitis without perforation as an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

C. Several large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a clear benefit of primary peritoneal drainage over laparotomy for the outcome of survival without neurodevelopmental delay.

D. The main difficulty of interpreting previous research studies is that patients undergoing laparotomy tended to have lower weight and were more acutely ill than were patients undergoing primary peritoneal drainage.

E. The procedure is generally reserved for larger neonates with birth weight greater than 1,500 g because most clinical trials and observational studies have focused on this population thus far.

25. Cesarean delivery has increased in the past few decades. Which of the following statements is most correct regarding the potential role of cesarean delivery on the neonatal microbiome and other adult disease?

A. Although cesarean delivery bypasses vaginal delivery, the maternal vaginal flora has already reached the amniotic fluid and fetal intestinal flora by approximately 35-weeks' gestational age; therefore, any differences in intestinal flora by mode of delivery is seen only in preterm neonates.

B. Epidemiologic studies have shown associations between cesarean delivery and allergic, autoimmune disease; however, further studies are needed to clarify the potential for confounding factors such as maternal antibiotic use before delivery and nutritional factors.

C. For maintenance of optimal intestinal flora for immune system development, neonates who have not breastfed by 1 to 2 hours of age now routinely receive an infant formula supplemented by probiotics.

D. Although there has been a movement to curtail the increase in cesarean delivery, a potential benefit of cesarean delivery to the neonate is reducing the exposure to pathogenic bacteria that may be associated with Crohn disease.

E. Although there may be some differences in gut flora of neonates delivered vaginally compared with that in those delivered via cesarean section, other environmental influences predominate after birth, and neonatal intestinal floras are virtually identical by 1 week of age, depending on geographic region.

36. A newborn is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit to rule out sepsis because of maternal symptoms of fever and being suspected of having acute chorioamnionitis. The mother and newborn are both treated with antibiotics. However, the laboratory evaluation is reassuring for the newborn, and the antibiotics are stopped at 48 hours. Which of the following statements supports this decision?

A. Fever is a specific symptom of chorioamnionitis and is a good longitudinal marker of severity of infection, such that a subsiding of fever after delivery indicates absence of a serious bacterial infection.
B. In the case of early ascending infection, the pregnant woman may be infected with bacteria and develop an inflammatory response with symptoms such as fever, but the fetus may not yet be infected.
C. Most newborns who have been identified as having sepsis risk factors have a bacterial infection but may not require antibiotics because maternal antibodies will clear the infection in most cases.
D. The placental pathological findings do not provide any real benefit in terms of guiding treatment decisions for the newborn.
E. The pregnant woman and fetus typically are infected at the same time, so maternal laboratory evaluation of blood culture and white blood cell count are very sensitive and specific tests for neonatal sepsis.

A. Compared with infections with positive blood cultures of other bacteria, CoNS infections are associated with significantly increased mortality in the neonatal period.
B. CoNS infections are unlikely to have any clinical effect because most positive cultures reflect contamination, particularly when a central line is in place.
C. CoNS infection definitively causes cerebral palsy for neonates born before 28-weeks' gestational age.
D. One main reason that the possibility of potential brain injury arising from CoNS infection is unlikely is that there is no good theory about the pathophysiological nature of how such an infection might lead to white matter injury.
E. One potential limitation in interpretation of studies that have shown an association of CoNS infection with neurodevelopmental delay is the lack of a consistent definition that demonstrates evidence of true clinical CoNS infection.

Which of the following is true regarding blood cultures?

A. A general rule is that $0.5\mathrm{mL}$ of blood sent for culture will result in a sensitivity of bacterial detection of $95\%$.
B. Because blood cultures are so often negative in the setting of neonatal sepsis, their utility is questionable, and sepsis should be treated on the basis of clinical judgment, without reliance on cultures.

63. You are planning for the delivery of a neonate with a woman whose pregnancy is complicated by placenta accreta. You are considering the studies on maternal and neonatal morbidity. Which of the following is true about placenta accreta and patient outcomes?

A. A delivery of a neonate from a woman with placenta accreta in which the placenta fails to appropriately separate from the uterine wall will lead to potential severe blood loss in the newborn but should have little consequence for the mother.

B. Due to the potential for maternal hemorrhage in a delivery with placenta accreta, a planned cesarean delivery and hysterectomy is typically required.

C. One of the main considerations will be the presence of intrauterine growth restriction or congenital anomalies, which are both associated with placenta accreta.

D. The average blood loss for women who deliver with placenta accreta is 1,000 to 1,500 mL.

E. The morbidity in neonates born to women with placental disorders appears related to the type of invasion, with placenta percreta leading to the worst outcomes, intermediate outcomes with placenta increta, and optimal outcomes for placenta accreta.

64. You are participating in a multidisciplinary discussion with obstetric and neonatal health care professionals about the evidence of the use of progesterone for prevention of preterm birth. Which of the following is true based on evidence from clinical trials?

A. A large study published in 2003 from the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network of more than 300 women found that progesterone was effective in reducing the risk of delivery prior to 32 weeks but was not effective in reducing risk of delivery prior to 37 weeks.

B. As early as 1990, a meta-analysis by Keirse showed a beneficial effect of 17-hydroxyprogesterone on reducing preterm birth with a pooled odds ratio of 0.50.

C. A study of the European Perinatal Network was stopped early due to increased incidence of hearing loss in newborns who had been exposed to progesterone injections via the mother.

D. One of the difficulties in the use of progesterone is that it appears to have a paradoxical effect of causing preterm labor and delivery in women who have had a previous history of preterm birth.

E. The primary evidence for the use of progesterone is derived from a large study of active women in the military that showed a 3-fold reduction in preterm birth for those receiving progesterone.

65. Several models have been designed or proposed to study preeclampsia. Which of the following statements describing research on preeclampsia is correct?

A. A model of reduced uterine perfusion pressure has been studied in rats as well as other animals; reduced uterine perfusion pressure has been found to cause proteinuria, hypertension, impaired renal function, and fetal growth restriction, although reduced trophoblast invasion does not occur.

B. A promising research area for preeclampsia is the promotion of angiogenic factors, with one preeclampsia model using suppression of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 in mice, leading to manifestation of preeclampsia as hypertension, proteinuria, and seizures during pregnancy.

C. Immune models for preeclampsia are based on the observation that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 concentrations are markedly increased in women with preeclampsia.

D. One model of placental maldevelopment involved administration of doxycycline to pregnant rats, which increased trophoblast invasion and increased placental mass.

She has gestational diabetes, which has been poorly controlled, and is suspected to be at risk for a fetus with macrosomia. Which of the following about her delivery course and management of her pregnancy is correct?

A. A key principle in the management of pregnant women who have diabetes is to disregard estimated fetal weight in the decision to perform cesarean deliveries due to its inaccuracy and lack of ability to predict clinical complications.
B. Although her neonate may have macrosomia, the risks of non-spontaneous labor induction on respiratory outcomes balance out risks of macrosomia, and, therefore, delivery should be deferred until spontaneous labor or induction at 41 weeks' gestation.

78. A male neonate is born at 37 weeks' gestational age to a mother with history of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Neurological symptoms lead to an evaluation that reveals neonatal stroke. Which of the following is true about risk of thrombosis and APS?

A. Neonates with perinatal thrombosis associated with APS often have other risk factors for thrombosis, such as a central vascular catheter or an inherited thrombophilia.
B. In most cases, antiphospholipid antibodies alone are sufficient for a major neonatal thrombotic event, typically manifesting as a microangiopathic stroke.
C. Most of the antiphospholipid antibodies that lead to neonatal thrombosis originate in the fetus/ neonate, and not the mother, as placental transfer is minimal after the first trimester.
D. The lack of cord blood or maternal serum antiphospholipid antibodies would rule out APS as the cause for thrombosis.
E. The pathophysiology of APS leads to venous thrombosis exclusively; therefore, the presence of arterial occlusion should raise suspicion of cord compression or acute volume loss at birth.

NEONATAL RESUSCITATION

1. Studies and guidelines for adult and pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) have changed over the past decade. Although these changes should not necessarily translate into guidelines for neonatal resuscitation, it may be beneficial to be aware of the guidelines for older patients. Which of the following is true regarding CPR for nonneonatal patients?

A. In adult CPR, epinephrine is contraindicated in all circumstances because of its myocardial depressive effect.
B. In adult CPR, studies have demonstrated that chest compressions without rescue breathing can significantly reduce the time to return of spontaneous circulation and can increase survival.
C. In both adult and pediatric CPR, chest compressions should be paused every 15 seconds for ventilations after a secure airway has been established.
D. The most recent guidelines for adult and pediatric advanced life support have recommended that the ratio of compressions to ventilation be coordinated at 3:1.
E. The recognition that ventilation is paramount for resuscitation in neonates has influenced adult CPR guidelines also to emphasize adequate ventilation over chest compressions, with the first minute of resuscitation focusing solely on airway and breathing in adults and older children.

Questions

11. You are preparing for a delivery of a neonate at 27-weeks’ gestational age. As you prepare the radiant warmer and other equipment and supplies, you consider the goals for resuscitation. Which of the following statements regarding thermal regulation for neonates is correct?

A. Preterm neonates have a relatively strong response to the initial exposure to the extrauterine environment because of an extra deposit of brown and black fat that builds up in the second trimester, which would subsequently have been resorbed in the late third trimester.

B. The American Academy of Pediatrics advocates for a goal temperature of 36.0°C or higher for both preterm and term neonates.

C. The fetus has a lower metabolic rate than both the mother during pregnancy and a neonate.

D. The temperature of a fetus before birth is the same as the core temperature of the mother.

E. The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of axillary temperature between 36.5°C and 37.5°C among neonates.

12. While waiting for the delivery of a neonate, the resuscitation team members review the neonatal resuscitation guidelines. One of the team members reminds you of the 3:1 ratio of compressions to ventilation. Which of the following statements is correct?

A. Although some number of chest compressions and efforts at ventilation are both recommended, there is actually no specific ratio recommended by any national resuscitation guideline group.

B. Animal studies have not shown any benefit of combining chest compressions with ventilation over chest compressions or ventilation alone.

C. Because profound bradycardia in a neonate is likely due to primary cardiac compromise, the first step before chest compressions should be application of an automated defibrillating device.

D. For neonates, this ratio is based on strong scientific evidence; a multicenter randomized controlled trial sponsored by the Neonatal Research Network found that a 3:1 versus 5:1 ratio led to improved survival and long-term neurodevelopment by 50% to 75% for both term and very low-birth-weight neonates.

E. One rationale for this ratio is the higher physiological heart rate of 120 to 160 beats per minute and breathing rates of 40 to 60 per minute in neonates.

13. A 28-weeks’ gestational age neonate is having significant sternal retractions and nasal flaring soon after birth. The neonate does not have any signs of apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is being considered as a therapy. Which is an accurate statement about this neonate?

A. Early CPAP may prevent the need for subsequent mechanical ventilation by forming and maintaining a sufficient functional residual capacity and a large enough tidal volume.

B. Gaseous distension of the stomach—CPAP belly—does not occur when nasal prongs are used.

C. Immediate intubation and aggressive mechanical ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cm and high tidal volumes will avoid later volutrauma and decrease the cytokine response compared with results with early use of CPAP.

D. The respiratory distress would not have been prevented had the mother been administered antenatal glucocorticoids.

E. The single nostril intubation technique is clearly superior to nasal prongs and/or mask CPAP.

14. In thinking about implementation approaches to setting up a video-recording program in the delivery room, which of the following is a possible approach?

A. A lawyer should review all recorded videos before anyone else to decide whether to erase immediately or otherwise determine whether the video is appropriate for purposes such as quality improvement and/or education.

B. Audio recording is generally not useful to study communication and teamwork because it is difficult to see who is speaking and environments are usually too noisy.

C. Camera feeds or direct synchronized data from monitors can be an objective measure of a neonate's clinical status and allow reviewers to assess the appropriateness of team interventions during resuscitation.

D. Motion-activated camera recordings are not allowed in hospitals because of invasion of privacy, but audio-triggered recording is allowable.

The neonate is apneic and, despite initial resuscitation efforts, requires intubation. Which of the following mechanisms of heat loss and efforts to prevent heat loss is described correctly?

A. Because radiant heat loss is the most common route of heat loss in preterm neonates, the most effective method of thermal regulation for this neonate will be to provide warm blankets.

B. Convective heat loss occurs when the neonate comes into contact with a cold surface, such as gloves or supplies that have not been prewarmed.

C. Evaporative heat loss is relatively minimal in preterm neonates because of the immaturity of the epidermis.

D. Heat loss via conduction occurs when neonates are in direct contact with cold surfaces.

The evidence that the use of 100% oxygen during resuscitation may be harmful has led to the current practice of initiating resuscitation with room air in all term newborns. Although there are methodological concerns with individual studies, a meta-analysis by Tan et al in 2005 of randomized or quasi-randomized trials involving newborns born at or near term in developing countries compared outcomes after resuscitation with room air versus outcomes after resuscitation with 100% oxygen. In this meta-analysis, of the following, the newborns resuscitated with room air, in contrast to those resuscitated with 100% oxygen, showed significant reduction in:

A. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
B. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
C. Infant mortality

29. A neonate is born after precipitous delivery at term gestation soon after the mother is admitted to the labor and delivery unit. Although there were no known risk factors, the neonate has grunting and respiratory distress right after delivery. He is brought to the resuscitation bed, but the warmer has not been turned on. Which of the following physiological responses to cold in the neonate is described correctly? A. A cold environment will typically lead to vasodilatation in the extremities, hypotension, and bradycardia. B. A response to cold external temperature involves stimulation of sympathetic pathways, which induces a surge in thyroid-stimulating hormone that leads to thyroxine and triiodothyronine release. C. Most neonates have an exaggerated shiver response even with minor exposure to a cold environment. D. The energy generated by white fat typically causes hyperthermia in cold environments, leading to paradoxical fever in up to 40% of neonates exposed to cold. E. Thermogenin is released in response to cold temperature and leads to apoptosis in the liver and kidneys.

Questions

14. A nurse in the newborn nursery is concerned that a 2-hour-old boy might have seizure activity. The newborn's prenatal course was benign and he was born via emergency cesarean following a late fetal heart rate deceleration.

15. A 38-week-gestational-age neonate was born after maternal placental abruption led to an urgent cesarean delivery. The delivery itself goes smoothly, but the amniotic fluid is noted to be bloody. The umbilical cord blood gases are obtained. The neonate is noted to have very low tone and is apneic at birth. The newborn is intubated and taken to the neonatal intensive care unit. An umbilical arterial catheter is placed and an infant blood gas is obtained. Which of the following statements regarding evaluation and treatment of this patient is correct?

A. A base deficit greater than 14 mEq/L would increase the probability of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
B. Although blood gases may be potentially useful data for assessing the need for hypothermia, they were never used in any clinical trial as an eligibility or evaluation parameter.
C. Ideally, the first infant blood gas should have been obtained after 6 hours of age to allow for metabolic equilibrium after the neonatal transition period.
D. In this case, the primary "sentinel event" would be the cesarean delivery occurring in an unexpected manner.
E. The umbilical cord gases should have been obtained after 60 seconds of delayed cord clamping.

16. A 2-month-old girl is being seen at the pediatric clinic for a well-child check. The mother notes that she had been taking antidepressants during her pregnancy. Which of the following aspects of evaluating an infant who has been exposed to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) as a fetus is characterized appropriately?

A. An infant exposed to SSRIs may have increased pain tolerance with decreased physiological response and crying in response to stimuli such as heel sticks.
B. Skin-to-skin contact has been shown to amplify the effect of neonatal adaptation syndrome, leading to prolonged symptoms for up to 2 months of age.
C. Studies assessing neurological activity and behavior in infants have consistently shown that while depression is associated with early neurodevelopmental delay and abnormal generalized movements, the use of SSRIs during pregnancy appears to attenuate this association.
D. The use of SSRIs during pregnancy has been associated with macrocephaly, with no such effect on head growth seen with maternal depression during pregnancy without SSRI use.
E. When comparing fetal growth between depressed mothers with and without SSRI use, fetuses in the non-SSRI group have higher rate of fetal weight gain but more prominent reduction in head growth.

25. A 39-week-gestational-age girl is diagnosed with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) following emergent cesarean delivery after cord prolapse. She is started on a therapeutic hypothermia protocol at 5 hours of age. Which of the following statements regarding hypothermia for HIE is correct?A. A great success of the 6 multicenter studies on therapeutic hypothermia across several countries was that they all had the same inclusion criteria, including cord gas parameters, physical examination staging, and requiring an amplitude-integrated electroencephalographic tracing for eligibility.Although most of the large randomized trials had a goal for starting hypothermia before 6 hours of age, the actual starting time for treatment was between 6 hours and 12 hours for most enrolled patients.The appropriate total duration of cooling time for this patient would be 24 hours, due to the severity of encephalopathy.The largest trials for therapeutic hypothermia have focused on newborns with mild or moderate encephalopathy, although the treatment is sometimes applied for severe cases in which survival is expected.The randomized trials for therapeutic hypothermia employed either a combination of head and body cooling or whole-body cooling alone, with core temperatures typically a degree lower in the whole-body cooling trials.

26. Which of the following statements regarding newer imaging techniques is correct?A. Cortical surface area measurements can be a useful tool to predict neurodevelopment, but the technique is possible only for neonates who are at least term equivalent postmenstrual age.Fractional anisotropy, as measured by diffusion tensor imaging, typically decreases through development of the preterm brain, and persistently elevated values can be a marker of brain injury.Increase in cortical and deep gray matter with decreased cerebrospinal fluid volumes is a risk for disability.Reduced white matter in the premotor, sensorimotor, and temporal cortices and reduced gray matter volumes in the sensorimotor and mid-temporal cortices have been associated with poor cognitive outcomes.Smaller cerebellar, but not cerebral, volumes have been shown to correlate with poor motor and cognitive outcomes for preterm newborns, at 2 years of age.

40. A newborn with signs of neonatal encephalopathy has umbilical catheters placed and you are considering the appropriate intravenous fluid for maintenance fluids. Which of the following is correct regarding current knowledge of appropriate therapy and corresponding rationale in management of glucose administration for this patient?

A. Although it is based on animal studies, there is a consensus approach in providing zero to minimal glucose during the first 24 hours after asphyxial injury and to gradually increase to a goal of having blood glucose levels of 40 mg/dL by 72 hours of age.

B. Although the theory is based on adult studies, it appears to benefit post-asphyxial patients to maintain serum glucose concentrations above 150 mg/dL during the first 72 hours after the inciting event.

C. Neither low nor high blood glucose level has been found to be associated with any adverse outcomes in neonatal encephalopathy.

D. One reason for the difficulty in studying hypoglycemia in neonatal encephalopathy is that glucose less than 45 mg/dL is exceedingly rare in the setting of asphyxia, occurring in less than 1% of neonatal encephalopathy patients.

E. To date, there have been no randomized clinical trials that have evaluated the effect of maintaining blood glucose concentration at designated levels after neonatal asphyxia.

The Apgar score is 3 at 1 minute, 4 at 5 minutes, and 6 at 10 minutes. The newborn receives positive pressure ventilation and is intubated. The blood gas shows a metabolic and respiratory acidosis. What is the current status of evaluation and practice for preterm newborns and neonatal encephalopathy?

A. Although the trials are still ongoing, due to the likelihood of benefit and low risk of harm, this patient should receive therapeutic hypothermia.

B. An Apgar score of 7 or less at 5 minutes is highly predictive of moderate to severe cerebral palsy at 3-year follow-up.

C. The Apgar score should not be recorded for preterm newborns, as the confounding nature of active resuscitation while recording the neonate's status leads to the score lacking any predictive ability.

D. There is utility in using the amplitude-integrated encephalogram in evaluating very low birth weight newborns and predicting short-term neurological outcomes.

E. The Sarnat classification system was originally designed to address preterm patients.

59. A term female neonate is born after shoulder dystocia, has seizure activity 1 hour after birth, and is diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. She is enrolled in a trial of erythropoietin (EPO) therapy. Which of the following is true regarding EPO and its potential role in treatment for this condition?As EPO receptors are not present in the neonatal brain, the mechanism of action is likely an indirect one that occurs primarily through renal EPO receptors.As EPO therapy for ischemic injury is primarily for conditions such as acute blood loss, it is not applicable for this clinical situation.Recombinant EPO does not cross the blood-brain barrier in most circumstances, but due to the capillary leak seen in hypoxic-ischemic injury, cerebrospinal fluid levels of EPO reach approximately 25% of serum levels for such neonates.The neuroprotective mechanism of EPO may result from the prevention of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation that can occur after hypoxic-ischemic injury.While EPO is well tolerated in preterm neonates, a difficulty in its use in term neonates has been its nephrotoxicity, which occurs in up to one-third of patients with hypoxic-ischemic injury.

60. A 29-week-gestational-age neonate is being cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit that has implemented the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP). Which of the following is true regarding this program for this neonate?A. A key component of NIDCAP is that findings that occur through observation of the neonate are discussed with the parents and staff, before recommendations are determined.Although the NIDCAP has been studied in various settings for assessment of parental satisfaction and efficacy, there are few reports to date on neonatal outcomes—and those are limited to clinical outcomes at hospital discharge.The appropriate time to start the NIDCAP intervention is when the neonate has established respiratory sufficiency (no positive pressure ventilation) and has shown readiness for at least minimal oral feedings daily.The first NIDCAP training centers were established in Sweden in 1982.There have been large studies and meta-analyses that have now demonstrated that NIDCAP leads to improved survival without disability, leading to consensus recommendations for implementation of NIDCAP or its various components for neonates younger than 28 weeks' gestational age.

61. A male newborn with signs of neonatal encephalopathy with an initial glucose of 35 mg/dL is now 4 days old. He receives a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his brain. Which of the following is true regarding imaging in this context?A. Abnormal findings on MRI, including corticospinal tract injury, are likely to be more commonly seen in patients who were hypoglycemic during the first 24 hours.At this relatively early age in the disease process, there are generally no abnormalities that are seen as a consequence of hypoglycemia or asphyxia.Early hypoglycemia appears to protect against seizure activity, possibly due to decreased white matter conductivity, which can be seen as decreased echogenicity in the temporal lobes seen on ultrasound and MRI.Persistent hypoglycemia has been found as a protective factor for MRI findings, with decreased injury seen in the temporal and frontal white matter when hypoglycemia has persisted for 2 to 3 days.The optimal brain imaging by MRI in this context is to administer 10 g/kg of intravenous dextrose just prior to the study, which will lead to substrate uptake by normal neurons and facilitate the evaluation of injured areas.

On clinical examination, it is noticed that the neonate's right arm is twitching periodically in a rhythmic fashion. Which of the following is correct regarding the relationship of aEEG and seizures? Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography is as accurate as or sometimes more accurate than conventional electroencephalography in detecting clinical and subclinical seizures.Although aEEG has been a useful tool for monitoring brain activity, a rare adverse effect in neonates with encephalopathy receiving hypothermia is the causation of petit mal seizures.Due to time compression algorithms necessary to produce the readings, a seizure must last at least 5 minutes to be detectable on aEEG.Seizures usually have an appearance of a gradual buildup and decline in frequency and an amplitude that includes repetitive spikes, sharp waves, or a single sinusoidal pattern that lasts 5 to 10 seconds.Most (>75%) neonatal seizures locate to the frontal-parietal lobes, and aEEG electrode placement should be focused in those areas during hypothermia therapy.

67. You are called to delivery of a woman who has had limited prenatal care. The newborn is noted to have a spinal defect. The newborn appears to be approximately 34 to 35 weeks' gestational age. The defect is covered according to protocol and the neurosurgical team is consulted after the newborn is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Which of the following describes the appropriate treatment for this patient? As one-third of patients may develop latex allergy, precaution to use non-latex gloves should be taken.Postnatal surgical repair should be delayed until after 72 hours to stabilize the fluid status, obtain appropriate imaging, and provide several days of nutrition.Preterm birth in this case is likely to have improved prognosis, as decreased exposure time to amniotic fluid by early delivery has been associated with improved prognosis.Unless there is evidence of active infection, antibiotics should be avoided during the surgical period to avoid eradication of normal microbiota.Ventricular shunt placement during the first month is not indicated, as surgical repair of the lesion will, in itself, alleviate the hydrocephalus in most cases.

Questions

5. A single-center study of a new inhaled medication for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is performed. The study is randomized and blinded using a sham saline inhaler for the control group. The primary outcome is oxygen use at 36-weeks' postmenstrual age. Parents are approached to enter their preterm neonate in the study soon after the neonate is born. After the study is completed, 25% of eligible neonates were enrolled in the study because of lack of consent in the other 75%. Compared with those who were not enrolled, subjects were more likely to be of higher birth weight and have less oxygen exposure. This hospital also has a high rate of oxygen use compared with that of other similar hospitals. Which of the following is a valid criticism of the study?

A. Because of the principle of risk-benefit, it is not ethical to have the physician taking care of the patient, or the researcher, blinded to the treatment group.
B. The generalizability of the study population compared with what may constitute the characteristics of populations generally seen in other units.
C. The κ factor in this study is low because the use of the inhaler may alter pulmonary physiological characteristics regardless of whether the neonate receives the medication or sham saline inhaler.
D. This study is not reliable because the outcome variable of oxygen use at 36 weeks lacks reproducibility and could be a function of random error.
E. To detect a dose-response relationship, a better design would have been to expose 1 group to the medication for the first 3 weeks and then switch to the sham inhaler and to have the second group receive the sham inhaler for the first 3 weeks and then switch to the medication.

PART 2: ANSWERS

# CARDIOLOGY

1.  A. Dextro-transposition of great arteries with coarctation of aorta or pulmonary hypertension

This rare clinical finding of reverse differential cyanosis is most often associated with dextro-transposition of the great arteries along with either coarctation of the aorta/interrupted aortic arch or with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.¹² In these conditions, the preductal partial pressure of oxygen (Pao₂) will be lower than the postductal Pao₂.

2.  Aziz K, Sanyal SK, Goldblatt E. Reverse differential cyanosis. Br Heart J. 1968;30(2):288–290

2.  C. Phosphodiesterase III inhibitor milrinone

Systemic afterload reducers such as the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor milrinone (0.375–0.75 mcg/kg/min) decrease systemic vascular resistance, which can lead to improved systemic blood flow.¹² Minimizing afterload may facilitate oxygen delivery to vital organs.

3.  B. Functional status of the right ventricle determines the approach to palliation.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) accounts for 7% to 9% of all neonates born with congenital heart defects. In HLHS, the right ventricle and tricuspid valve represent the systemic ventricle and atrioventricular valve, and their functional status determines the approach to palliation.¹ An unrestricted interatrial communication is critical to survival.

4.  C. QRS axis ranges from +55° to +200°

In a term neonate, the QRS axis ranges from +55° to +200°, and the normal QRS duration, as measured in lead V₅, ranges from 20 to 80 ms. In the preterm newborn, the QRS axis ranges from +65° to +174°.

6.  E. Reference range of blood pressure values from a cohort of healthy neonates who have experienced no adverse outcomes

The most common approach of defining hypotension has been to define normality in a cohort of healthy preterm neonates by creating reference ranges for blood pressure on the basis of birth weight, gestational age, postnatal age, or a combination of the 3.¹ For a neonate of known gestation or birth weight, hypotension is defined as blood pressure less than the 3rd, 5th, or 10th percentile at any given postnatal age. Although

a number of blood pressure reference ranges have been devised and published, many studies have had methodologic problems, including retrospective data collection, relatively small study sample sizes, inclusion of neonates who have evidence of cerebral injury, and use of noninvasive blood pressure measurements.

## 7. B. Blood vessel diameter

Large vessels (conduit arteries) and small vessels (intraparenchymatous arteries and arterioles) contribute about equally to vascular resistance, large arteries because of their length and small arteries and arterioles because of their small diameter. Even a minor change in diameter induces a significant change in resistance. For example, a 10% reduction in diameter results in a 35% increase in vascular resistance.

## 8. D. Nitric oxide

The primary endothelial products thought to be responsible for the pulmonary vascular changes during transition include nitric oxide and arachidonic acid metabolites. Nitric oxide production increases dramatically at the time of birth. Pulmonary expression of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase and its downstream target, soluble guanylate cyclase, increases during late gestation.¹

## 11. B. Ectopic atrial tachycardia

When an ectopic focus in the atria consistently depolarizes more quickly than the sinus node, the sinus node is suppressed, and the fetus develops an ectopic atrial tachycardia. Although the area of initial activation in the atria cannot be determined with routine fetal echocardiography, pulsed-wave fetal Doppler imaging can reveal an atrial contraction that precedes each ventricular contraction. In addition, ectopic atrial tachycardia can often be distinguished by the way it speeds ("warms") up and slows ("cools") down with atrial rates that usually range from 180 to 240 beats per minute.¹

## 14. A. Hyponatremia may be seen in some cases.

Vasopressin has been used for refractory hypotension in adults and children. The primary effects seen include improvement in blood pressure and cardiac output as well as a decreased requirement for catecholamines.¹ The adverse effects most commonly seen with vasopressin use are due to its vasoconstrictive properties and effects on the V₂ receptor, leading to increased water retention in the renal tubule, which can lead to hyponatremia.²

## 15. A. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia

The most common association with nonrenal hypertension in neonates is bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Hypertension is reported to have a high incidence of 13% to 43% in neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.¹,² Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is thought to be related to increased systemic arterial stiffness.³ Corticosteroid treatment for such patients can contribute to transient hypertension.⁴

## 17. A. Amiodarone

For fetal supraventricular tachycardia, digoxin remains the usual first-line therapy, primarily because of its relative safety for the pregnant woman and fetus. When digoxin is unsuccessful, a number of other antiarrhythmic agents have been used with varying success, including flecainide, sotalol, and amiodarone. Amiodarone may achieve cardioversion in more than 90% of fetuses with atrioventricular reentry.¹

In persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), ventilation-perfusion mismatch and extrapulmonary right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood across the patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus result in cyanosis. Because of high pulmonary vascular resistance, there is decreased blood flow to the lungs because the blood takes the path of least resistance, which is the systemic circulation.¹

Nephrogenesis continues postnatally in preterm neonates until 36-weeks' estimated gestational age, and injury to developing nephrons secondary to any insult, whether hypoxia, hypotension, and/or nephrotoxin exposure, leads to more significant and chronic sequelae. Commonly used agents for hypertension include vasodilators such as hydralazine, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be avoided in preterm neonates, those with acute renal failure, and those with hyperkalemia.¹

The pathologic anatomy of the mitral and aortic valves defines the major subtypes of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Either or both of these structures may be stenotic or atretic, leading to 3 anatomic subtypes: mitral atresia and aortic atresia (30%), mitral stenosis and aortic atresia (25%), and mitral stenosis and aortic stenosis (45%).¹ Defining the anatomic subtype for HLHS is relevant in terms of surgical approach and prognosis. In particular, mitral stenosis and aortic atresia are known to be higher-risk lesions secondary to the presence of coronary-cameral fistulas in approximately one-half of these patients.²,³

Patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome are admitted to the intensive care unit for further assessment, monitoring, and initiation of prostaglandin therapy to maintain systemic output through ductus arteriosus patency. Balancing of the parallel systemic and pulmonary circulations is the major task preoperatively, with the goal of achieving a pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio of 1:1. Although transplant is a potential option, surgical advancements and the lack of donor hearts with high waiting-list mortality has made transplant a less common choice.¹

26. A. Dopamine at low doses (0.5–2.0 mcg/kg/min) acts on dopaminergic receptors.

Dopamine is an endogenous sympathomimetic that potentiates release of norepinephrine in addition to having direct action on α, β, and dopaminergic receptors.¹ Potential effects may include α₁ receptor stimulation, leading to systemic vasoconstriction, and β₁ receptor stimulation, which increases cardiac output through positive inotropy (myocardial contractility) and chronotropy (heart rate). Dopaminergic receptor stimulation increases renal blood flow through renal vasodilation, change in tubular absorption, and positive inotropy.² The receptor effects of dopamine are dose dependent in children and adults, with a low dose (0.5–2.0 mcg/kg/min) acting on dopaminergic receptors, a medium dose (2–6 mcg/kg/min) acting on cardiac β₁ receptors, and a higher dose of greater than 6 to 10 mcg/kg/min acting on α₁ receptors.²

27. B. Hypercapnia-induced vasodilation mediated through extracellular hydrogen ion concentration requires a basal level of nitric oxide.

Hypercapnic vasodilation is reduced by 50% when neuronal nitric oxide synthetase is blocked in the adult rat brain. The hypercapnic response is restored by addition of a nitric oxide donor. This suggests that a basal concentration of nitric oxide is necessary for the pH to act, at least in some species. More recently, it has been suggested that it is the function of the calcium-activated potassium- and adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels, which are necessary for hypercapnic vasodilation, and that the full opening of these channels depends on a basal level of nitric oxide.¹

Congenital heart disease screening is less sensitive in detecting cardiac lesions that may not manifest with early hypoxemia.¹ These neonates may pass the congenital heart disease screen and be discharged after an unremarkable and brief birth hospitalization. Coarctation may not manifest with symptoms until the ductus arteriosus closes. When congenital heart disease is suspected, the definitive diagnostic test is echocardiography.

29. C. Milrinone has an inotropic effect by causing decreased breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) inhibitor with inotropic, inodilator (promotes myocardial contractility and produces vasodilation), and lusitropic (promotes myocardial relaxation) properties. The inotropic effect results from decreased breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate by PDE3, perpetuating calcium influx into myocardial cells and resulting in myocardial contraction.¹⁻³

Norepinephrine is an endogenous catecholamine that increases systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output by activation of α₁,₂ and β₁ receptors. Norepinephrine constricts systemic vasculature to a greater degree than it constricts pulmonary vasculature.⁴ Dobutamine is a synthetic sympathomimetic amine that acts directly on α and β receptors without the release of norepinephrine.⁵

30. E. Prophylactic administration of hydrocortisone in association with concurrent indomethacin therapy has been associated with spontaneous intestinal perforation.

Corticosteroids aid in the management of hypotension by decreasing the breakdown of catecholamines, increasing calcium levels in myocardial cells, and upregulating adrenergic receptors.¹ Adverse effects of corticosteroids include hyperglycemia, gastric irritation, and fluid retention. Long-term exposure increases the risk of osteopenia and inhibits immune function and somatic growth. In considering the use of hydrocortisone in the setting of a normal cortisol level, a “normal” level in the setting of stress may indicate relative adrenal insufficiency, so it is likely that such a neonate will respond to hydrocortisone supplementation.

In a randomized clinical trial, neonates exposed to histologic chorioamnionitis had lower mortality when treated prophylactically with hydrocortisone soon after birth.² This trial was halted early because of the high incidence of spontaneous intestinal perforations in the treatment group. Subsequent analysis revealed that this complication occurred predominantly in the setting of concurrent indomethacin therapy.²

Blood pressure measurements obtained with oscillometric devices are generally considered comparable with invasive intra-arterial measurements.¹ However, in neonates who are ill, these measurements may not be ideal because oscillometric devices can overestimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared with blood pressure values obtained from invasive methods.² Therefore, direct arterial blood pressure monitoring is preferable in this particular population.

NOTCH1 mutations leading to decreased signaling have been found in families with calcific aortic valve stenosis and HLHS.¹

For patients with HLHS, sibling recurrence risk is 8% for HLHS and 22% for any congenital heart disease.² Copy number variants, defined as regions of DNA gain or loss, happen at increased frequency in pediatric patients with cardiac defects, including in HLHS.³ Turner syndrome, or monosomy X, is commonly associated with bicuspid aortic valve and aortic coarctation and less commonly associated with HLHS.⁴

Therapy with digitalis or other positive inotropic agents is contraindicated unless there is a decrease in cardiac contractility because it could make the patient's condition worse. β-Blockers may be used as well in consideration of pulmonary vasodilator agents such as inhaled nitric oxide if pulmonary hypertension is determined to be an important component of disease.¹,²

## 39. D. Prostaglandin E1 infusion

The initial management of newborns who have hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) physiology focuses on safe transport and hemodynamic and respiratory stabilization. The principal goal is to return the newborn to the intrauterine state. Reestablishment of ductus arteriosus patency via prostaglandin E1 infusion is the priority to reestablish systemic blood flow.¹ Because prostaglandin E1 can cause apnea, precautions to secure the airway before transport may be necessary.

## 40. A. A typical course for patients is regression or resolution of ventricular hypertrophy, irrespective of therapy, at approximately 1 month of age.

The prognosis for neonates who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in association with maternal diabetes is generally excellent with the current state of neonatal care. Hemodynamic challenges frequently are associated with diastolic dysfunction and occasionally with systolic dysfunction. Even in neonates who have symptoms, the disease is self-limited, and recovery is typical after several weeks of supportive care. Way et al¹ described a series of 11 infants of mothers with diabetes who presented with congestive heart failure in the first week after birth and who were followed up until age 40 months. All patients were asymptomatic at approximately 1 month of age, and echocardiography revealed regression or complete resolution of the ventricular hypertrophy, irrespective of the therapy.

## 41. E. The preterm neonate may have relatively low systemic blood flow because of the structure of the preterm myocardium, which may be less able to overcome the increased systemic vascular resistance that occurs after birth.

At birth, the lower-pressure umbilical circulation is eliminated, resulting in increased systemic vascular resistance. Because of the structure of the preterm myocardium, there may be a lack of ability to overcome this increased resistance, leading to low systemic blood flow. Hence, neonates born at less than 30-weeks' gestation commonly have low systemic blood flow, which contributes to low blood pressure.¹

Positive pressure ventilation may contribute to decreased systemic blood flow by increasing the intrathoracic pressure and decreasing the venous return.² In both preterm and term neonates, chorioamnionitis can be associated with hypotension, which may be caused by the release of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, which lead to peripheral vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.³

43. B. At normal levels of hemoglobin (15 g/dL), the presence of 3 to 5 g/dL of reduced hemoglobin results in 20% to 30% desaturation, and cyanosis is visible at oxygen saturation of approximately 70% to 80%. In neonates, the occurrence of cyanosis is greatly influenced by the hemoglobin level. At a normal hemoglobin level of 15 g/dL (150 g/L), the presence of 3 to 5 g/dL (30–50 g/L) of reduced hemoglobin results in 20% to 30% desaturation. Therefore, cyanosis is visible when oxygen saturation is approximately 70% to 80%. In polycythemic neonates (hemoglobin level ≥ 20 g/dL [200 g/L]), the presence of 3 to 5 g/dL (30–50 g/L) of reduced hemoglobin would lead to 15% to 20% desaturation, and cyanosis would be visible when oxygen saturation is reduced to 80% to 85%.

44. B. It has minimal chronotropic effects.

Administration of vasopressin may be useful in shock states when patients are likely to have low endogenous circulating arginine-vasopressin concentrations. Vasopressin has the added benefit of having minimal chronotropic effects. Vasopressin is administered by means of intravenous infusion. Vasopressin has the potential for pulmonary vasodilation. It is likely to have continued vasoconstrictive effects during periods of hypoxemia and acidosis.

45. E. The gold standard method of blood pressure measurement in neonates remains direct intra-arterial monitoring.

On average, oscillometric devices read 5 mm Hg higher for mean blood pressure than do intra-arterial measurements. Several devices also display higher blood pressure measurements than intra-arterial values in the smallest neonates, creating the potential to underrecognize hypotension. The ability to achieve good correlation between direct and indirect measurements is related to the use of the appropriate-sized cuff. Intra-arterial monitoring remains the gold standard of blood pressure measurement.

46. A. Adding a view to include the left- and right-sided outflow tracts to the usual 4-chamber views at 20 weeks' gestation can improve the detection rate of cardiac anomalies from 60% to 90% if performed by a trained specialist.

Routine obstetric ultrasonography typically is performed at 20 weeks' gestation in low-risk pregnancies, usually including a 4-chamber view to display both atria, both ventricles, the atrial and ventricular septum, and the mitral and tricuspid valves. For a trained specialist, this view can demonstrate up to 60% of congenital heart defects. However, without the use of additional imaging views, the diagnosis of congenital heart defects affecting the aortic and pulmonary valves (eg, pulmonary and aortic valve stenosis), the great arteries (eg, transposition of the great arteries and truncus arteriosus), and the venous systems is nearly impossible. By adding a view to include the left- and right-sided outflow tracts, the detection rate improves to approximately 90% if performed by a trained specialist.

47. A. For neonates, the preferred initial therapy is oral propranolol.

Noonan syndrome is the most common cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in neonates and children younger than age 4 years. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the mechanism of action of β-blockers, such as propranolol, includes slowing of the heart rate and prolongation of diastole, which allows for an increase in ventricular filling. Although it is commonly used for adults, verapamil is contraindicated in neonates. Medical therapy does not alter the prognosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is primarily used for relief of symptoms. In the patient without symptoms who has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, medical therapy is controversial.

49. A. At moderate doses of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min, dopamine predominantly increases cardiac contractility and heart rate by stimulating the cardiac β₁-, β₂-, and α₁-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.

Dopamine is the inotropic medication most commonly used for hypotension in neonates. It exerts a dose-dependent stimulation of the α- and β-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. Pharmacodynamic data on dose-related effects of dopamine in the neonate are limited. In adults and children, dopamine at low doses (2–4 mcg/kg/min) dilates renal and splanchnic vessels by its action on dopaminergic receptors. At moderate doses (5–10 mcg/kg/min), it predominantly increases cardiac contractility and heart rate by stimulating the cardiac β₁-, β₂-, and α₁-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. At high doses (≥ 10–20 mcg/kg/min), dopamine increases peripheral vascular resistance by stimulating vascular α₁ receptors.

The evidence for the use of vasopressin in neonatal patients with cardiac disease comes largely from observational studies. Vasopressin has shown some short-term efficacy either before or after the development of severe hypotension or uncompensated shock after cardiopulmonary bypass in neonates.[1,2] These outcomes include decreased need for further vasopressor support and fluid resuscitation. However, the effect of vasopressin on long-term outcomes is not clear.

Measurement of the direction of the ductal and foramen ovale shunt, flattening or left deviation of the interventricular septum, and tricuspid regurgitation velocity at continuous wave Doppler imaging with simultaneous systemic blood pressure measurement provides an indication of right-sided pressures and hemodynamic physiologic mechanisms.¹

Approximately 1 in 8 neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) has a chromosomal abnormality, with the most commonly associated abnormalities being trisomy 21, trisomy 18, 22q11.2 deletion, and trisomy 13.¹ The presence of chromosome abnormalities or genetic syndromes may convey an additional risk for neurodevelopmental impairment. For example, DiGeorge syndrome or 22q11.2 gene deletion is found in approximately 12% of neonates with CHD, particularly those with conotruncal lesions.² Neonates with 22q11.2 deletion are at increased risk for seizures, neurocognitive delay, autism, schizophrenia, and other social-interactive disorders.³

55. B. Doppler imaging pattern of the pulmonary venous flow

Determining the adequacy of the atrial communication is an important part of fetal assessment in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), with the potential need for fetal or immediate neonatal intervention in patients with a restrictive atrial septum. The actual size of the foramen ovale has not correlated well with the degree of left atrial hypertension after delivery. $^{1}$ A more reliable assessment is pulmonary vein flow patterns assessed with spectral Doppler ultrasonography. The pulmonary vein Doppler imaging pattern in the normal heart consists of forward flow into the left atrium during systole and early diastole, with either cessation of flow or a small amount of flow reversal during atrial contraction. In HLHS, pulmonary venous return is unable to pass through the stenotic or atretic mitral valve and seeks an alternate pathway, shunting from left to right through the foramen ovale. If this atrial communication is restrictive, left atrial hypertension ensues, and flow reversal with atrial contraction becomes more prominent in the pulmonary veins. $^{1-3}$

Intrauterine detection of fetal heart disease has significantly improved over the past few decades because of improved technology, use of universal screening ultrasonography, and proliferation of specialized fetal centers. Detection rates vary with the type of defect, with anomalous pulmonary venous return, transposition of the great arteries, and left-sided obstructive lesions showing the lowest rates (0%–20%) and cases of heterotaxy syndrome and single ventricle (such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome) being associated with higher detection rates (50%–80%).

## 57. C. Patient factors such as genetic syndromes and low birth weight may have a larger effect than do operative factors in determining neurodevelopmental outcomes.

In the current era of surgical repair and preoperative and postoperative care, survival for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) can be as high as 74% to 93%. With increasing survival rates, neurodevelopmental outcomes and quality of life have become more prominent as outcomes of concern. Multiple factors may contribute to the neurodevelopmental outcomes in patients with HLHS, including prenatal factors, such as ischemia and microcephaly, presumed to be secondary to altered cerebral blood flow, prematurity, cardiac anatomic factors, associated neurologic malformations, genetic conditions, postnatal chronic cyanosis, and surgical factors, including exposure to cardiopulmonary bypass and surgical technique. The significance of patient factors, such as genetic syndromes and low birth weight outweighs operative factors. $^{1-3}$

## 58. D. Neonates with premature atrial contractions or atrial bigeminy are usually treated with observation because the prognosis is excellent and the resolution of these usually occurs within the first 4 weeks after birth, often within a few days.

Several types of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias can occur in the fetus and neonate, including premature atrial contractions, ectopic atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and supraventricular tachycardia. $^{1,2}$ Neonates with premature atrial contractions or atrial bigeminy are treated with observation. The prognosis is excellent, with resolution usually occurring within the first 4 weeks after birth.

Multifocal or chaotic atrial tachycardia is diagnosed when there are 3 or more P-wave morphologies in the tachycardia. This rhythm may resemble atrial fibrillation. Ectopic atrial tachycardia can often be distinguished by the way it speeds up and slows down, with atrial rates that usually range from 180 to 240 beats per minute.

The rate of atrial flutter, if conducted 1:1, is usually 300 beats per minute but may conduct with 2:1 block at a rate of 200 beats per minute.

64. E. Variation in ALDH1A2, an enzyme important for retinoic acid production, has been associated with TOF.

Retinoic acid signaling that regulates outflow tract development is mediated by transforming growth factor-β signaling. Variation in ALDH1A2, an enzyme important for retinoic acid production, has been associated with cases of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Compound heterozygosity for mutations of genes involved in laterality, such as ZIC3, PITX2C, FOG2, NODAL, NKX2-5, and FOXH1, have been identified in patients with isolated transposition of the great arteries.

Patients who have dilated cardiomyopathy with a potentially reversible cause, such as anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery may benefit from surgery, which can minimize the development of ventricular dysfunction. Neonates with the disease should be tested for genetic, infectious, and metabolic causes. This may include testing for intrauterine or postnatal viral infection by using polymerase chain reaction or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of the blood or tracheal aspirate fluid.¹

FISH uses probes to analyze genetic content. FISH is useful for determination of deletion or duplication events, which cannot be determined by means of sequencing. Diagnoses such as 22q11 deletion syndrome or cri du chat del 5p and other microdeletions or duplications are commonly made using FISH. Subtelomeric FISH can also be used to assess for rearrangements in the telomere-associated repeat sequences at the distal ends of chromosomes. Such studies are especially useful in patients with multiple congenital anomalies and normal karyotype. A newer technique, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, is replacing FISH to detect genetic anomalies.¹ It requires a very small amount of DNA and can detect differences in a single nucleotide; therefore, it can detect small single-gene variations that may not be detected with FISH.

69. A. Although neonates with HCM of mothers with diabetes may appear edematous, they are actually obese, and diuretics could be counterproductive.

Therapy for neonates with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) includes:
- Maintenance fluids
- Mechanical ventilation if necessary
- Correction of hypoglycemia and hypomagnesemia
- Early diagnostic echocardiography and close follow-up
- Avoidance of inotropic agents
- Avoidance of diuretics unless there is objective evidence of fluid overload

70. D. Esmolol

Drugs to facilitate therapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy include β-blockers; short-acting β-blockers, such as esmolol, are preferable. Inotropic agents and diuretics are not typically recommended.

71. E. Ventilation of the lungs and an increase in oxygen tension lead to pulmonary vasodilation.

The transition from fetal to extrauterine life is associated with several events in circulation. Clamping of the umbilical cord removes the low-resistance placental circulation, increasing systemic arterial pressure. Various mechanisms lead to reduced pulmonary resistance and increased pulmonary blood flow. The most important stimulus to promote pulmonary vasodilation appears to be ventilation of the lungs and an increase in oxygen tension.¹ An 8-fold increase in pulmonary blood flow occurs, which raises left atrial pressure, closing the foramen ovale. Because the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases lower than systemic vascular resistance, flow reverses across the ductus arteriosus (from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, or left to right). The increase in arterial oxygen saturation leads to closure of the ductus arteriosus and ductus venosus.

Epinephrine is an endogenous catecholamine that is released by the adrenal gland in response to stressful stimulation. It has a potent nonselective α-agonist action and causes activation of both β₁- and β₂-adrenergic receptors.¹ Epinephrine increases blood pressure and systemic blood flow by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. Epinephrine administered at low dosages (0.01–0.1 mcg/kg/min) stimulates β receptors, leading to enhanced myocardial contractility and peripheral vasodilation. At higher doses (&gt; 0.1 mcg/kg/min), additional stimulation of α receptors causes peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance.²

Pulmonary valve atresia is characterized by the absence of blood flow across the pulmonary valve as a result of a membrane-like structure in the region of the pulmonary valve. Pulmonary atresia can occur with an intact ventricular septum or with a ventricular septal defect. In cases of intact ventricular septum, there is often hypoplasia of the right ventricle. Pulmonary blood flow will depend on a patent ductus arteriosus.

80. D. Preterm neonates are more susceptible to ischemia with low blood pressure and to hemorrhage with high blood pressure.

Cerebral autoregulation, in which arteries constrict in response to an increase in transmural pressure and dilate in response to a decrease in pressure, allows for an almost constant blood flow with a range of arterial blood pressures. This ability to autoregulate is immature in preterm neonates and occurs only over a narrow range of blood pressures. Hence, preterm neonates are particularly susceptible to ischemia with low blood pressure and to hemorrhage with high blood pressure.¹

Differential cyanosis occurs when the upper extremities are pink and the lower extremities are blue.

For hypertension in neonates, a targeted physical examination should include 4-extremity blood pressure (BP) readings to help detect possible aortic coarctation.

Medications used in preterm neonates, such as caffeine and theophylline, may cause increased BP. Genetic characteristics may play a role in BP variation in neonates, although limited studies have been completed to date.¹

Capillary refill time is a widely used clinical sign, but its widespread use has not been supported by research demonstrating its usefulness or validity. The core-peripheral temperature difference frequently is used as a clinical monitoring method to assess the state of peripheral perfusion. However, in preterm newborns, core-peripheral temperature gradients may not be accurate because of the immaturity of autonomic control. The absence of an association between systemic blood flow and left and right ventricular outputs is 1 reason for suggesting that superior vena caval flow, which reflects upper body venous return and is less influenced by shunts, may better reflect cerebral perfusion.¹

No data exist on the adverse effects of chronic BP elevation in infancy, and few if any antihypertensive medications have ever been studied in neonates; however, sustained BP values at the 99th percentile or higher are likely to be harmful over time, so most experts recommend that neonates with BPs in this range warrant consideration of use of antihypertensive medications.

The management of hypertension in neonates is largely based on expert opinion and experience and the notion that sustained elevated blood pressures (BPs) are likely to lead to adverse effects.¹

The management of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) has significantly improved during the last 2 decades. The emphasis has shifted from hyperoxygenation-hyperventilation-alkalosis to improved gentle ventilation strategies to optimize lung recruitment and minimize oxygen toxic effects and permissive hypercapnia paired with the therapeutic use of surfactant and inhaled nitric oxide. Oxygen is a specific and potent pulmonary vasodilator but may be detrimental if used in excess. Even brief exposure to 100% oxygen in newborn lambs resulted in increased contractility of pulmonary arteries, reduced response to inhaled nitric oxide, and increased potential for oxidative stress.[1,2]

In critical congenital heart disease screening conducted using pulse oximetry, preductal (right upper extremity) saturations are compared with postductal (lower extremity) saturations. A failed screening is when 1 of these findings occurs:

- The oxygen saturation value is less than 90%.
- Oxygen saturation is less than 95% in the right hand and foot on 3 measurements, each separated by 1 hour.
- The difference between pre- and postductal saturations is greater than 3% on 3 measurements, each separated by 1 hour.

87. A. Mean arterial pressure will generally increase with vasopressin use.

The primary role of vasopressin in the body is to regulate extracellular osmolality, and it is administered therapeutically for diabetes insipidus. Vasopressin also has vascular effects via stimulation of G protein-coupled V₁ₐ and V₂ receptors in the cardiovascular system. The V₁ₐ receptors located on vascular smooth muscle lead to vasoconstriction, whereas the V₂ receptors lead to vasodilatation. Vasoconstrictive effects predominate when vasopressin is used as an intravenous infusion, resulting in increased systemic vascular resistance and increased mean arterial blood pressure. Administration of vasopressin is thought to be especially useful in shock states when patients are likely to have low endogenous circulating arginine-vasopressin concentrations.

Neonatal blood pressures can increase by up to 20 mm Hg during feeding. A neonate's blood pressure may also be higher when sucking on a pacifier, crying, or being tilted or held with the head up. A protocol adapted from Nwankwo and colleagues¹ suggests placing an appropriately sized cuff on the neonate's right upper arm with the neonate lying; leaving the neonate undisturbed for 15 minutes; and obtaining 2 to 3 measurements over 5 minutes, when the neonate is sleeping or settled, as far between feedings as possible.

89. E. Most significant bradycardia secondary to atrioventricular conduction disease is related to complete heart block; in approximately 50% of these cases, maternal autoantibodies are detectable.

The most common type of fetal bradycardia is sinus bradycardia, which may be due to vagal stimulation secondary to pressure from the ultrasonographic transducer, fetal distress, or systemic disease. Although bradycardia can be seen in cases of lower-degree atrioventricular block (first and second degree), most significant bradycardia secondary to atrioventricular conduction disease is related to complete heart block. In approximately 50% of these cases, maternal autoantibodies (anti-SSA/Ro and/or anti-SSB/La) are detectable, with the remainder of fetuses showing structural heart disease.¹

The finding of a hyperechogenic fetal intracardiac focus is, in most cases, of no clinical consequence and may not even be detectable postnatally. However, its presence is associated with a higher likelihood of the presence of a chromosomal abnormality, such as trisomy 21.²

Rhabdomyomas are almost exclusively found in patients who have tuberous sclerosis and occur as multiple tumors that show a tendency to regress over time.

Echocardiographic tools, including 2-dimensional structural evaluation; M-mode analysis; and tissue, color, and pulsed-wave Doppler imaging, are all useful in fetal diagnosis and treatment. However, these modalities continue to have limitations in that the mechanical results of the arrhythmia are used to make assumptions about the underlying electrical activity.¹

Fetal electrocardiography, which allows for a more direct evaluation of fetal cardiac conduction, is still limited by poor data quality and interference from maternal signals.

Fetal magnetocardiography allows for acquisition of high-quality fetal cardiac signals, leading to a more specific and accurate arrhythmia diagnosis, but is limited in usefulness because of rare availability.²

Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by dilatation and abnormal contraction of 1 or both ventricles. A diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy requires evidence of dilatation and impaired contraction of the left ventricle or both ventricles. This abnormal contractility is quantified by using echocardiography according to a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% or a fractional shortening less than 25%.¹

## 93. A. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase

Nitric oxide production increases dramatically at the time of birth, being produced by nitric oxide synthase. Pulmonary expression of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase and its downstream target, soluble guanylate cyclase, increases during late gestation.

Endothelin-1 plays a role in maintaining high pulmonary vascular tone in utero. Peroxynitrite is a free radical, which may be increased in the setting of therapy with high levels of oxygen and inhaled nitric oxide.

## 94. A. Increases during the first days after birth

Blood pressure is low at birth and increases during the first few days. It also increases with increasing gestational age and birth weight. $^{1}$

Because blood pressure is a function of both blood flow and systemic vascular resistance, it is possible to have a low blood pressure with normal blood flow or a normal blood pressure with low blood flow. Thus, there is a weak relationship between mean blood pressure and left ventricular output. $^{2}$

## 96. C. Hyperdynamic precordial activity

The physical examination findings in hypoplastic left heart syndrome may vary with newborns who seemingly appear well at birth. Although there will be a complete admixture of systemic and pulmonary venous return, pulmonary blood flow relative to marginal systemic blood flow is increased, resulting in oxygen saturation greater than 85%, and cyanosis may be difficult to recognize at this level. Certain clues can increase suspicion of the presence of a critical heart lesion. Hyperdynamic precordial activity is a consistent finding that reflects right ventricular volume and pressure overload. Decrease in amplitude of peripheral pulses often is cited but typically is evident only after ductal constriction in a newborn with symptoms. The second heart sound is single if aortic atresia is present. A heart murmur of tricuspid valve regurgitation or increased pulmonary blood flow may be audible.

## 97. B. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase

The reaction catalyzed by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase requires energy from adenosine triphosphate, which is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate and pyrophosphate, and results in the formation of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase. To gain access to the mitochondria, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase reacts with carnitine at the mitochondrial outer membrane to form acylcarnitine in a reaction catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I). Carnitine acyltranslocase then transfers acylcarnitine across the inner mitochondrial membrane where carnitine palmitoyltransferase II regenerates long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and releases carnitine. CPT I is an important site of regulation of fatty acid oxidation by the fetal and newborn heart. $^{1}$

## 98. B. High vagal tone

Wandering atrial pacemaker, characterized by a change in P-wave axis and morphology, is due to a shift of the pacemaker from its usual location in the sinus node to other sites in the atrium and in the atrioventricular junction. This condition is a benign arrhythmia but generally is associated with high vagal tone. It may also accompany other bradyarrhythmias.¹

## 99. C. Subclavian artery to the ipsilateral pulmonary artery

For the placement of systemic-to-pulmonary shunts for conditions such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, there is likely to be a diminutive or atretic aorta, necessitating both a shunt and the Norwood procedure. In the Norwood procedure, the main pulmonary artery trunk is transected from the branch pulmonary arteries and used to reconstruct the hypoplastic aortic arch, creating a new aorta. Because the size of the aorta in most patients who have hypoplastic right ventricles is adequate, they generally only require shunts. The most common shunt used in both patient populations is the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, in which a graft is interposed between the subclavian or innominate artery and the ipsilateral pulmonary artery.¹ Pulmonary blood flow depends on this connection.

## 100. A. Administer a prostaglandin E infusion

Reverse differential cyanosis is a rare clinical manifestation and is likely to indicate dextro-transposition of the great arteries along with either coarctation of the aorta or persistent pulmonary hypertension. Failure of adequate mixing of systemic and pulmonary venous blood because of a restrictive patent foramen ovale or persistent pulmonary hypertension would be the major cause of death.¹ After initial stabilization, including oxygen (for both therapy and diagnosis), prostaglandin E infusion would be the next step to facilitate mixing. Septostomy may be a further step if a restrictive patent foramen ovale is contributing to morbidity.

Incontinentia pigmenti is an X-linked dominant disorder. Males are affected by antenatal lethality, whereas females have a variable phenotype. Partial deletion of the gene IKBKG is found in most cases.¹ Newborns present at or shortly after birth with characteristic skin findings and variable ocular and neurologic abnormalities. Skin findings follow Blaschko lines, which correspond to embryonic mesodermal and epidermal cell migration pathways. Neonates present in the vesicular stage, which then can progress to subsequent verrucous, hyperpigmented, and hypopigmented stages. Skin biopsy specimens of vesicles will show spongiosis with eosinophils and dyskeratotic keratinocytes.

## 11. E. Topical timolol 0.5% gel-forming solution can be used after tapering propranolol to prevent rebound.

Adverse effects of propranolol include bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and bronchospasm. Although hypoglycemia is a potential adverse effect, routine glucose screening has not been deemed necessary. Many patients with PHACES syndrome have been treated successfully with propranolol.

Rebound after treatment course can occur.¹ Therefore, tapering is a common practice. However, propranolol that has been stopped more suddenly, perhaps because of illness or a period of decreased feeding, has appeared to be safe. A topical timolol gel-forming solution can be used to prevent rebound after tapering propranolol. Topical timolol also can be a treatment for some infantile hemangiomas, particularly those that are superficial.²

ENDOCRINOLOGY

1.  C. Limit the glucose infusion

Good physiologic control and improved enteral and parenteral nutrition are the foundations of reducing the incidence and associated complications of hyperglycemia. Enhancing amino acid intake can directly counter catabolic conditions and promote endogenous insulin and insulinlike growth factor 1 secretion and their anabolic effects.¹ Intravenous glucose infusion rates should be limited to just the rate that produces normal glucose concentrations. Lipid infusions should be limited during hyperglycemia. Insulin therapy should be reserved as much as possible for severe hyperglycemia because the benefits of insulin in the setting of hyperglycemia in preterm neonates have not been demonstrated.²

The placenta is freely permeable to thyrotropin-releasing hormone, but transplacental passage of thyroid-stimulating hormone or thyroglobulin is absent.¹

3.  E. 40 mcU/mL

Values obtained in different clinical laboratories vary depending on the assay used. In that context, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values more than 20 mcU/mL after 24 hours and more than 10 mcU/mL after the first postnatal week generally are consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Serum thyroxine and free thyroxine concentrations usually are decreased but may be normal initially. A serum TSH value of more than 40 mcU/mL suggests the possibility of permanent congenital hypothyroidism, a medical emergency.¹

Genital ambiguity usually is due to virilization of genetic female neonates or undervirilization of genetic male neonates who have normal gonads. In female neonates, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, specifically 21-hydroxylase deficiency, is the most common condition leading to inappropriate virilization.

5.  D. 24 hours

7. B. A positive glycemic response to intravenous glucagon during a hypoglycemic episode

The requirement of high glucose delivery (&gt; 8 mg/kg/min, normal range 4–6 mg/kg/min) to maintain normoglycemia suggests that there may be a defect in regulation of basal insulin secretion.¹ In cases that are difficult to diagnose, supportive evidence can be provided by decreased serum levels of insulinlike growth factor binding protein 1, a positive glycemic response to intramuscular or intravenous glucagon at the time of hypoglycemia (increase in blood glucose of &gt; 1.5 mmol/L despite severe hypoglycemia), and a positive glycemic response to octreotide.

10. C. One mechanism of action of corticosteroids is through the inhibition of catecholamine metabolism, blocking reuptake of circulating catecholamines.

Corticosteroids affect blood pressure through many mechanisms, both acutely and chronically. In the acute phase, corticosteroids inhibit catecholamine metabolism.¹ This blocks reuptake of circulating catecholamines, which increases blood pressure. As a secondary effect, glucocorticoids upregulate cardiovascular adrenergic receptors through increased gene expression, which can provide a sustained response to treatment.

The use of hydrocortisone simultaneously with indomethacin has been associated with increased risk for spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation.²

This remains constant regardless of maternal nutritional status. Estimated accretion rates approach 120 mg/kg/d of calcium and one-half that rate for phosphorus between 24 weeks’ and term gestation.¹⁻³ As a result, preterm neonates have not achieved optimal bone mineralization at the time of their birth.

### D. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia

The most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in a 46,XX female is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is an autosomal recessive condition secondary to a defect in cortisol synthesis. A 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of CAH and accounts for 95% of cases; however, 11-hydroxylase deficiency and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency can also cause virilization of a female. The block in the production of cortisol leads to shunting of cortisol precursors toward the androgen pathway, which leads to virilization of the external genitalia.

In aromatase deficiency, patients are unable to convert androgen precursors to estrogen. Aromatase deficiency in the placenta leads to virilization of both the mother and the fetus. Maternal causes of androgen excess that can lead to virilization of a 46,XX newborn include virilizing adrenocortical tumors, ovarian tumors, or luteomas. Disorders of ovarian development in a 46,XX individual that can manifest as ambiguous genitalia include ovotesticular disorders of sexual development and 46,XX testicular disorders of sexual development.1, 2

### A. Free thyroxine

Malnutrition, liver immaturity, and other complications of prematurity such as respiratory distress syndrome also lead to lower concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, which can lower total thyroxine concentrations.1 Therefore, many authors recommend measuring only free thyroxine in this population to assess thyroid hormone status.

### E. Müllerian duct remnants

Decreased 5α-reductase activity is a cause of undervirilization of genetic males and leads to varying degrees of ambiguity, ranging from a blind vaginal pouch to mild hypospadias with bifid scrotum.

Partial androgen resistance results in a spectrum of genital ambiguity. The androgen receptor is located on the X chromosome, and, therefore, transmission is X linked. Family members who have the same androgen receptor mutation can have different phenotypes, which makes partial androgen insensitivity syndrome challenging to diagnose. Mutations that lead to complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, however, result in normal female external genitalia. Müllerian structures such as the uterus typically are absent, and testes may be intra-abdominal or in the inguinal canal.1

### B. Propylthiouracil is the preferred drug in the first trimester, although it has been associated with minor birth defects, primarily face and neck cysts.

Antithyroid drugs in pregnancy are potentially teratogenic.

However, propylthiouracil exposure has also been associated with minor birth defects, primarily face and neck cysts, in 2% to 3% of cases.2

18. B. An inactivating mutation in the KCNJ11 gene

Congenital forms of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of conditions caused by mutations in 9 different genes: ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, CGK, HADH, SLC16A1, HNF4A, HNF1A, and UCP2.¹ The most severe forms are due to mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11, which encode the 2 components of pancreatic β-cell adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel). These mutations abolish the function of the KATP channel and are therefore unresponsive to diazoxide, a KATP channel agonist.

Patients with recessive mutation in the gene encoding the mitochondrial enzyme short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase or hyperinsulinism hyperammonemia syndrome are generally responsive to diazoxide.²

After birth, plasma insulin levels decrease, and rapid surges of catecholamine and pancreatic glucagon release occur. These endocrine changes switch on essential enzymes for glycogenolysis (release of glucose stored as glycogen in the liver, cardiac muscle, and brain), gluconeogenesis (glucose production from 3-carbon precursor molecules by the liver), lipolysis (release of fatty acids from adipose tissue stores), and ketogenesis (β-oxidation of fatty acids by the liver to produce ketone bodies).¹

21. B. CYP21 gene mutation

Mutations of the 21-hydroxylase gene, CYP21, are the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in North America. In its classic salt-wasting form, adrenal crisis occurs between 1 and 4 weeks of age, with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and shock.

22. B. Thyroglobulin

In contrast to the low circulating thyroxine concentration, serum concentrations of thyroglobulin, the storage form of thyroxine, are higher in the preterm than in the term neonate, particularly in those who are sick. Given the attenuated postnatal thyroid-stimulating hormone increase in preterm neonates, it is likely that impaired thyroglobulin clearance or degradation, rather than increased secretion, plays an important role.1

Clinical signs of fetal hypoxia are more common in diabetic than nondiabetic pregnancies. Neonatal polycythemia and increased nucleated red blood cells in cord blood also occur frequently in pregestational diabetic pregnancies.1 The fetus adapts to chronic hypoxia by redistributing its cardiac output and maintaining its blood flow to the brain and heart and by increasing its erythropoietin synthesis to increase the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Both elevated fetal plasma and amniotic fluid erythropoietin levels are markers of intrauterine chronic hypoxia.2

## 28. B. The initial noticeable symptoms of hypoglycemia that may indicate exhaustion of alternative fuel stores are often nonspecific, such as irritability, lethargy, or poor feeding.

When neonatal hypoglycemia results in clinical signs of brain injury, the temporal evolution is as follows:

- Low blood glucose levels are found, but the neonate does not have clinical signs because he or she is still able to draw on alternative fuel stores such as glycogen and fat.
- If untreated, the neonate exhausts alternative fuel stores and develops subtle clinical signs that are not specific to hypoglycemia, such as irritability, lethargy, and poor feeding. Hypoglycemia is not damaging at this stage.
- If untreated, the neonate develops obvious and severe clinical signs, such as seizures or coma. There may still be avoidance of damage if treated promptly.
- If not treated rapidly after the onset of these severe clinical signs, hypoglycemia becomes damaging and in severe cases results in cardiorespiratory arrest.

## 29. D. Impaired regulation of core temperature

Clinical findings in preterm neonates who are critically ill and in shock may include delay in capillary refill, worsening regulation of core temperature, apnea, tachypnea, and poor renal function with oliguria or anuria. Furthermore, patients can be hypotensive and tachycardic. Patients in shock secondary to adrenal insufficiency may also have hypoglycemia; however, hypoglycemia may be masked in neonates who are critically ill and receiving constant dextrose infusions.

36. B. The development of the external male genitalia is dependent on the activity of dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase.

Production of anti-Müllerian hormone by the Sertoli cells leads to involution of the Müllerian (female) internal ducts. The development of the external male genitalia is dependent on the activity of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is converted from testosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT induces development of the penis from the genital tubercle and of the urethra from the urogenital sinus, as well as fusion of the labioscrotal folds to form the scrotum.

37. C. Neonates with high tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP), low to normal parathyroid hormone levels, and hypophosphatemia will benefit from phosphorus supplementation.

Parathyroid hormone increases calcium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney and inhibits phosphorus reabsorption in the proximal nephron.

Phosphate deficiency is considered the earliest manifestation of poor bone mineralization. In this setting, TRP = (1-[(urine phosphorus × serum creatinine)/(serum phosphorus × urine creatinine)]) × 100 is greater than 95%.

Neonates with high TRP levels, low to normal parathyroid hormone levels, and hypophosphatemia will benefit from phosphorus supplementation.

41. D. The stimulus for cortisol synthesis starts in the hypothalamus with the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone.

The stimulus for synthesis of cortisol begins in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone, which stimulates the pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the adrenal cortex, specifically the zona fasciculata, to synthesize and release cortisol. Cortisol has many varied effects systemically, which include maintenance of glucose homeostasis, alteration of inflammatory responses, regulation of hemodynamic stability in times of illness and stress, and maintenance of electrolyte balances.¹

Serum calcium levels are typically normal in neonates with metabolic bone disease because of the rapid response of the calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands.

A chromosomal microarray analysis is recommended to look for small deletions or duplications that may not be identified at routine karyotype testing. For patients with ambiguous genitalia and nonpalpable gonads, there should be a high suspicion of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

## 44. B. Birth to a mother with autoimmune thyroid disease

Most newborns with neonatal thyrotoxicosis are born to mothers with autoimmune thyroid disease, most commonly Graves disease. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis has been described in women with Hashimoto thyroiditis and is caused by the transplacental passage of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin. $^{1,2}$

## 45. B. Fetal pituitary luteinizing hormone

The critical period for external virilization of the genitalia is within the first 12 weeks of gestation. In the first trimester, testosterone production from the Leydig cells is driven by placental human chorionic gonadotropin. Fetal pituitary luteinizing hormone secretion increases during the second trimester and stimulates phallic enlargement and testicular descent.

## 46. B. 12

The fetal thyroid gland starts secreting thyroid hormones during approximately week 12. In addition, fetal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors become responsive to TSH and TSH receptor antibodies during approximately week 20. $^{1-3}$

## 47. D. Although diagnostic evaluation is performed, it will be important to maintain normal glucose levels to avoid brain injury because brain hypoglycemia will be exacerbated by a lack of ketone bodies or lactate.

In hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, insulin secretion becomes dysregulated, driving glucose into insulin-sensitive tissues, such as skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. There is inhibition of glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and ketogenesis, which prevents the generation of alternative energy substrates such as lactate and ketone bodies. The effects of hypoglycemia on the brain are further compounded by the lack of these alternative substrates for the brain to use. Hypoketotic hypofattyacidemia in the presence of hypoglycemia is the key metabolic milieu that predisposes the neonate to hypoglycemic brain injury. $^{1}$

In neonates born at 31 to 34 weeks, thyroxine (T₄) levels peak at 7 hours (125 nmol/L) and are approximately 20% greater than cord levels, whereas levels in neonates born at or before 27 weeks are static, approximately 60 nmol/L during this period. $^{1}$ Triiodothyronine levels in neonates born at 31 to 34 weeks increase 2-fold and peak at 7 hours (1.24 nmol/L), whereas in neonates born at or before 27 weeks, levels increase initially by approximately 60% at 1 hour (0.53 nmol/L) and decrease thereafter. For all gestational age groups, T₄ sulfate levels peak at postnatal day 7 and thereafter decrease. $^{2}$

50. A. Any neonate who presents with abnormal clinical signs, such as lethargy, should have blood glucose measured, with other relevant testing based on symptoms.

The process of diagnosing hypoglycemia must begin with identifying neonates at risk of failure or delay in metabolic adaptation and then monitoring blood glucose levels and clinical signs. Alternatively, for a neonate not previously thought to be at risk but who presents with any concerning clinical signs, there must be prompt and accurate blood glucose measurements.

51. B. Thyroid peroxidase

Antithyroid drugs inhibit thyroid hormonogenesis by interfering with the action of the key thyroid enzyme, thyroid peroxidase.

52. E. Throughout gestation, the inner fetal zone of the adrenal cortex makes up approximately 80% of the cortex and produces fetal androgens.

Adrenal cortex development can be observed as early as day 25 of gestation. The fetal adrenal cortex consists of a smaller outer definitive zone, which is dormant in terms of cortisol production until later in gestation, and a larger inner fetal zone. Throughout gestation, the fetal zone makes up approximately 80% of the adrenal cortex and produces fetal androgens, including dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Between the outer and inner areas, there is a transitional zone that is thought to produce cortisol toward the end of fetal development. The fetal zone undergoes hemorrhagic necrosis after birth and completely involutes by age 6 months.

53. D. Radiographs of the wrist and knee can be used to assess bone health, but 1 limitation is that bone demineralization may not be readily apparent until at least 20% of bone loss has occurred.

To assess bone health, experts recommend radiography of the wrist and/or knee because these regions are of high metabolic activity. However, bone demineralization may not be easily apparent in this imaging technique until at least 20% of bone loss has occurred. Koo and Tsang¹ developed the following scheme for assessing severity:

- Normal: normal density with white line at metaphyseal region
- Grade 1: loss of dense white line at metaphyses, thinning of cortex
- Grade 2: loss of dense white line at metaphyses, thinning of cortex, irregular frayed or cupping to metaphyses
- Grade 3: bone changes seen in grade 1 and grade 2 in addition to fracture

54. B. Both propylthiouracil and methimazole can be detected in human milk.

Both propylthiouracil and carbimazole (methimazole) can be detected in human milk. Propylthiouracil is highly protein bound, so it is at a lower concentration in the milk than is methimazole. Thyroid function and later neurodevelopment remain normal with maximal daily doses of 20 mg of methimazole or 450 mg of propylthiouracil, so breastfeeding is regarded as safe with maternal antithyroid drug use at or below these doses.¹⁻³

# 56. D. CYP21

Mutations of the 21-hydroxylase gene CYP21 are the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in North America. In its classic salt-wasting form, adrenal crisis occurs between 1 and 4 weeks of age, with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and shock.

# 57. D. Sex-determining region Y gene

During embryogenesis, the fetus contains both female (Müllerian) and male (Wolffian) genital ducts. Müllerian ducts give rise to the fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper one-third of the vagina; Wolffian ducts develop into the vas deferens, epididymis, and seminal vesicles. The default pathway of the bipotential gonad and internal structures is female. However, the presence of the sex-determining region Y gene in males activates a cascade of events that culminates in differentiation of the gonad as a testis.

# 58. A. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is considered the gold standard for assessing bone mineralization and fragility. DEXA focuses on a region of skeletal interest and yields bone mineral content and density. However, normative data and guidelines for use in neonates are lacking, making interpretation of DEXA results challenging. Disadvantages also include expense, radiation, and possible need for sedation. Unlike in adults, the z score (not the T-score) is the variable used to assess bone health in children.¹

# 59. D. Insulinlike growth factor

Although glucose and insulin drive fetal growth, insulinlike growth factor 1 and insulinlike growth factor binding protein 3 also drive fetal growth. Leptin, adiponectin, cortisol, and other factors have been measured in neonates of mothers with diabetes, but whether these factors also modulate fetal growth or cause other morbidities has not yet been determined.

# 60. B. Increased circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine

One of the most common causes of hyperglycemia is increased circulating stress-reactive hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones, whether induced by stress or by infusion to promote cardiac output and increase peripheral vascular resistance, inhibit both insulin secretion and insulin action. Such effects are not limited to neonates born closer to term, who have more mature sympathetic nervous systems and adrenal development; they also are common in preterm neonates. These effects also have been demonstrated in fetal life.¹,²

Children who have severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss may not obtain sufficient benefit from hearing aids. A trial period with hearing aids can help to determine whether the aid will allow for normal speech and language development. Typically, this trial period can be for at least 6 months. Cochlear implants become a consideration at approximately 1 year of age if speech and language are not developing and the benefit from hearing aids is determined to be inadequate. Children receiving implants by 12 months of age demonstrate better language development than do children who receive their cochlear implants between 13 and 24 months.¹

Vascular malformations can manifest in the nose at birth and grow with the child. These malformations may enlarge suddenly if there is hemorrhage or thrombosis, leading to respiratory distress. Magnetic resonance imaging is best for differentiating lesions; hemangiomas manifest as enhancing high-flow lesions and venous malformations as enhancing low-flow soft-tissue masses.

Hemangiomas typically grow rapidly after birth. They will resolve over several years. They can occur on the skin of the nasal vestibule and nasal tip, on the nasal mucosa on the septum, or along the turbinates.

## 23. A. Neural crest cells migrate from the anterior skull base to form the bony cartilaginous skull base and nasal vaults.

The nose begins development during the third and fourth weeks of gestation. Nasal placodes derived from ectoderm will eventually form the olfactory epithelium. By the fifth week, the placodes invaginate and become pits that extend backward toward the oral cavity. They are separated by the bucconasal membrane, which will dissipate at approximately day 38 of gestation. The frontonasal process lies between the placodes and develops into the nasal septum and palate.

During this process, the maxillary processes fuse with subdivisions of the frontonasal process, the lateral and medial nasal processes. The processes will form the anterior nares and the nasolacrimal groove that forms the nasolacrimal duct.

Pyriform aperture stenosis is an extreme bony narrowing of the premaxillary pyriform aperture. This condition can be associated with holoprosencephaly. Holoprosencephaly is a consequence of failure of the prosencephalon to divide, resulting in a single-lobed brain structure and varying degrees of skull and facial defects.¹

Dermoid cysts are lined by stratified squamous epithelium associated with adnexal structures. This differentiates them from epidermoid cysts that do not contain skin appendages. Dermoid cysts may contain hair follicles and sebaceous or eccrine glands. Dermoid cysts are unlike teratomas or teratoid cysts, which are derived from all 3 embryonic layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm); dermoid cysts include only derivatives of the ectoderm and its derived neural crest mesectoderm.

Encephaloceles and gliomas histologically may appear similar because they both have predominance of glial tissue. There should not be pulsation or expansion of gliomas with crying or straining. Encephaloceles occur most commonly in the occipital (75%) followed by the frontal (25%) region.¹

53. D. Pathologic reflux can worsen structural or neurologic laryngomalacia by inducing inflammation of the supraglottic mucosa.

There are 2 clinically distinct forms of laryngomalacia. The structural or nonneurologic variant is caused by foreshortened, tight aryepiglottic folds, which partially block the glottic inlet. There may also be an abundance of supra-arytenoid tissue that can prolapse into the posterior glottic airway. The neurologic variant occurs in children with neurologic diseases and may share some of these anatomic features. However, there is an additional component of global hypotonia that worsens tissue prolapse. Pathologic reflux can worsen both of these types of laryngomalacia by inducing inflammation of the supraglottic mucosa. The neurologic variant is associated with a lower rate of spontaneous resolution, a higher incidence of secondary airway lesions, and pathologic gastroesophageal reflux.¹

Ototoxicity from aminoglycosides is often irreversible and affects both cochlear and vestibular function.¹ A proposed mechanism of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is that aminoglycosides accumulate in the cochlear mitochondria where they inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis by interacting with the 12S ribosomal RNA. This leads to a decrease in adenosine triphosphate production in cochlear cells.

Pyriform aperture stenosis is a bony narrowing of the most anterior aspect of the nasal airway. The clinical manifestation may include persistent respiratory distress or apnea. In severe cases, a suction catheter may not pass through the anterior nasal vestibule. In patients in whom pyriform aperture stenosis is suspected, an otolaryngology consultation should be obtained so the area of stenosis can be determined with nasopharyngoscopy. If stenosis is present or suspected, it should be further explored with computed tomography. A pyriform aperture of 11 mm or less is diagnostic and is often accompanied by a single central mega-incisor.¹,²

The disruption of normal vascular development that occurs in retinopathy of prematurity can be characterized by the following 2 phases:

- First, vaso-obliteration or incomplete vasculogenesis results from several abnormal consequences of premature birth. Placenta-produced IGF-1 levels, which play a role in retinal vascularization, are reduced.¹ Relative extrauterine hyperoxia reduces VEGF levels.² Retinal avascularity and ischemia combined with the increasing metabolic demand of the developing retina produces tissue hypoxia, which leads to increased levels of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF and erythropoietin.³
- Second, the vasoproliferative phase begins at 32- to 34-weeks' gestational age. Pathologic neovascularization occurs during which growth is deregulated in direction, amount, and function.²,⁴,⁵

## 64. C. Idiopathic vocal cord adductor muscle hyperactivity

Bilateral vocal cord paralysis cases often are due to an adductor palsy that leaves the vocal cords in close apposition to each another.¹ In some cases, there can be severe airway compromise that leads to the need for emergent tracheostomy. Because the vocal cords remain in close approximation, voice quality may not be affected despite marked respiratory distress.

2.  A. Peak vacuum created during sucking coincides with lowering of the newborn's tongue.
Coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing improves with age. Even term newborns require additional maturation after birth, with term newborns at 4 to 5 days of age showing improved coordination compared with term newborns at 2 to 3 days of age.¹ Feeding coordination in preterm newborns depends more on postmenstrual age than chronological age, supporting a need for neurological maturation.² Whereas term newborns have 10 to 30 sucks per burst, preterm newborns born at 32-weeks' gestational age have 3 to 5 sucks per burst.³

The first phase of newborn sucking involves suction, which corresponds with a negative intraoral pressure that occurs when milk is pulled into the newborn's mouth. The period of maximum vacuum occurs when the newborn's tongue is lowered, allowing milk to enter the mouth. Thereafter, when the tongue is raised, the vacuum decreases, and the flow of milk stops.⁴

Manganese is a trace element provided in neonatal parenteral nutrition. This compound activates specific enzymes (eg, superoxide dismutase), plays a role in bone structure, and assists with carbohydrate metabolism. A neonate who is deficient in manganese can develop dermatitis, hair depigmentation, growth failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive amounts can lead to basal ganglia injury as a result of manganese deposition.¹

Other trace elements have also been associated with toxicities,¹,² including the following:
- Chromium (chronic renal failure)
- Copper (cirrhosis of the liver)
- Molybdenum (disruption of copper metabolism)
- Zinc (decreased leukocyte and phagocyte activity)

Excessive selenium has not been associated with toxicity.

5. C. 25-hydroxyvitamin D

There are distinct forms of vitamin D in the circulation, each with a different half-life. Although 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has a half-life of 12 to 24 hours, vitamin D has a half-life of 1 to 2 days, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D has a half-life of 2 to 3 weeks. Because of its long half-life, the amount of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D correlates best with the nutritional vitamin D status in a neonate.

6. B. Homocysteine

Folates are important in the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and the amino acids serine and methionine. They also are involved in the degradation of the amino acids homocysteine and histidine.

7. B. Insensible water loss

When managing the fluid and electrolyte needs of an extremely preterm neonate, as described in this vignette, the primary focus is to account for insensible water loss. This type of water loss is attributable mostly to transepidermal water loss. The degree of transepidermal water loss is affected mostly by gestational age, postnatal age, and ambient water vapor pressure.¹² Preterm neonates are poorly able to regulate the amount of insensible water loss, with improvement in this ability with increasing postnatal age.

8. B. 10 days

The estimated survival time for a newborn who weighs 2,000 g at birth and does not receive an external nutrient supply is closest to 10 days. A newborn who weighs 1,000 g at birth has sufficient energy reserve to survive 4 days without external nutrition. On the basis of extrapolation of these data, a newborn with a birth weight of 500 g has an estimated survival time of approximately 2 days.

9. C. Each episode of childbearing

One benefit of breastfeeding is a reduction in the risk of breast cancer.¹² A meta-analysis of 47 studies found that the relative risk of breast cancer decreased by 4.3% for every year of breastfeeding; this was in addition to the 7% reduction in risk that was found with each childbirth experience.³ The mechanism of this reduction is not known.

- Infrequent or ineffective pumping
- Breast shield with a tight fit
- Initiation of progestin-based contraception

11. D. Low income

In the United States, women who are African American and have a low income are more likely to deliver a very low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonate. This group is also less likely to initiate breastfeeding. This has implications in studies that are examining the benefit of breast milk for VLBW neonates because low-income families may be underrepresented.

## 12. D. Hepatitis B

The Human Milk Banking Association of North America has established standards for human milk banks in the United States. After the primary care physician has cleared a potential donor, the candidate undergoes a screening process. Potential donors are excluded if they have:

- A history of a positive blood test for HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or syphilis
- Risk factors for HIV infection in the donor or sexual partner
- Illegal drug use
- A social history positive for smoking
- A history of an organ or tissue transplant
- Received a blood transfusion in the past 6 months
- More than 2 alcoholic drinks per day on a regular basis
- Resided in the United Kingdom for more than 3 months or in Europe for more than 5 years during the period between 1980 and 1996
- Was born in or has traveled to Gabon, Niger, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, or Equatorial Guinea
- A daily intake of herbal supplements or medications (except for progestin-only contraceptives, levothyroxine, insulin, prenatal vitamins)

At the expense of the milk bank, donors also need to undergo serologic screening for HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis.

## 13. B. 120 mcg/kg/d

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that preterm neonates receive 108 mcg/kg/d of copper. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommends that preterm neonates receive 117 to 156 mcg/kg/d of copper. Data have shown that there is no difference in preterm neonates who received either 121 or 294 mcg/kg/d of copper.¹ Zlotkin et al² recommend that preterm neonates receive 120 mcg/kg/d of copper in their diet.²

Zinc is an abundant trace element in humans that is important for the structure and function of proteins. Zinc is involved in gene expression; neurotransmission; the inflammatory response; and the metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.¹,² In humans, the predominant storage site for zinc is bone (40% of the total) and the liver (15%–25% of the total).¹

The highest amount of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in humans is found in the brain and retina. In the brain cortex, the greatest concentration occurs in the synapses,¹ and in the retina, the highest amount is concentrated in the photoreceptor cells. Preterm neonates have lower amounts of LCPUFAs in the brain and retina because intrauterine acquisition is decreased.²

17. D. The degree of initial hypocalcemia soon after delivery worsens with decreasing gestational age. Approximately 30% to 57% of neonates born preterm have hypocalcemia, which is defined as a total serum calcium concentration less than 7.0 mg/dL (1.75 mmol/L). Immediately after birth, neonates have a decrease in serum calcium concentration, and the severity of this hypocalcemia is greatest in neonates of younger gestational age. This early hypocalcemia of prematurity is usually not associated with any symptoms. It typically occurs in the first 3 days after birth, followed by a slow increase in calcium concentration, with normal concentrations at 7 to 10 days of age.

18. A. His requirement for protein accretion for optimal growth is 3.5 to 4 g/kg/d. Extremely low-birth-weight neonates require 3.5 to 4 g/kg/d of protein to meet their caloric needs. Intravenous glucose infusions should be started at a rate of 5 to 6 mg/kg/min and could be increased up to 12 mg/kg/min. Beyond that amount, there may be resultant carbon dioxide retention, which could be an issue in neonates receiving ventilation. Extremely preterm neonates have a resting energy expenditure of approximately 50 kcal/kg/d, with a fecal energy loss of approximately 10 kcal/kg/d.

19. E. Although some studies have linked packed red blood cell transfusions to necrotizing enterocolitis, further studies are needed to determine whether withholding feedings is beneficial, and if so, to determine the optimal timing of feeding practice surrounding transfusions.

Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether necrotizing enterocolitis is associated with feeding before, during, or after a blood transfusion in preterm neonates. Similarly, further studies are needed to assess the effect of feeding in neonates with a patent ductus arteriosus. If a patient requires treatment for a patent ductus arteriosus, ibuprofen may be preferable to indomethacin because of a potentially milder effect on mesenteric blood flow and possible reduced risk for necrotizing enterocolitis.¹

20. C. 350 mcg/kg/d

Neonates with a mean gestational age of 29 weeks had higher serum zinc concentrations when parenteral nutrition was supplemented with zinc at doses of 350 mcg/kg/d.¹ Studies found that 350 mcg/kg/d of supplemental zinc was needed to reach zinc accretion rates attained in utero.² Current recommendations suggest that extremely low-birth-weight neonates receive 350 to 400 mcg/kg/d of zinc during the first few weeks after birth.

21. A. A possible starting point could be switching to a hydrolyzed protein formula.

The neonate described in this vignette most likely has gastroesophageal reflux disease, a common finding in preterm neonates. In neonates, a milk protein allergy can mimic gastroesophageal reflux disease, so a trial of hydrolyzed protein formula might be helpful, or breastfeeding mothers can alter their diet and exclude milk and eggs. In addition, a trial of thickened formula with oatmeal rice may be considered in neonates beyond 40-weeks' postmenstrual age. Altering neonate positioning during sleep to the prone or side-lying position is not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.¹ Because the reflux in preterm neonates most often results from nonacid reflux, antireflux medications are not effective.

22. C. Pasteurization of donor milk eliminates both HIV and cytomegalovirus, and milk banks culture postpasteurization samples to ensure cultures are negative.

Pasteurized donor human milk banks are produced by 3 groups in the United States:

- Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA) in Fort Worth, Texas¹
- Medolac, a commercial bank in Lake Oswego, Oregon²
- Prolacta Bioscience, a commercial bank in Minerva, California³

Each location has a different method of recruitment and procedural approach. Medolac and Prolacta Bioscience provide incentives to donating mothers, but HMBANA does not pay donors. HMBANA pools the donor milk, which then undergoes Holder pasteurization with heating to 62.5°C for 30 minutes. This process eliminates HIV and cytomegalovirus. The milk designated for preterm neonates is also cultured after pasteurization to ensure that culture-negative milk is provided to this vulnerable population.

23. D. The prevalence of severe cholestasis is 14% with parenteral nutrition duration between 14 and 28 days.

Similar to the neonate described in this scenario, preterm neonates who receive parenteral nutrition for a prolonged period while feedings are delayed have a higher risk for cholestasis. This risk is observed mostly in neonates who receive parenteral nutrition for more than 14 days.¹ The incidence of cholestasis increases with increasing parenteral nutrition duration so that the prevalence is 14% in neonates who received parenteral nutrition for 14 to 28 days, with severe cholestasis occurring in 42%, 72%, and 85% of neonates who received parenteral nutrition for 29 to 56 days, 57 to 100 days, and more than 100 days, respectively.¹,² For neonates with parenteral nutrition–associated cholestasis, enteral feedings should be introduced and advanced as soon as possible.³

24. D. Late-onset sepsis

Manzoni et al¹ randomly assigned 472 very low-birth-weight neonates to receive bovine lactoferrin, bovine lactoferrin combined with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, or placebo for the first 30 days after birth. The groups that received bovine lactoferrin with or without the probiotic had a lower incidence of late-onset sepsis. In another study, bovine lactoferrin supplementation for 6 weeks was associated with a lower incidence of invasive fungal disease in very low-birth-weight neonates.²

25. B. Decrease early weight gain

Studies have found that the use of donor milk in preterm neonates is associated with a lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis than is formula use.¹,² There is also a suggestion that use of donor milk is associated with better lipoprotein profiles and a slightly lower blood pressure during adolescence than is seen in formula-fed controls.³,⁴ However, most studies have shown that the administration of banked milk has been associated with a decrease in early weight gain.¹

## 26. C. Ensures that staff in all hospital areas dealing with newborn care are trained in breastfeeding management and support

The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative was introduced by the World Health Organization to encourage hospitals worldwide to promote and support breastfeeding.¹ The program recommends that all hospital staff members working with newborns receive training. Although the program was focused on newborns in the nursery, this training has had the additional benefit of improved breastfeeding rates in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The 10-step initiative does not address formula use or kangaroo care in the NICU. Although hospitals that meet the goals of the program receive Baby Friendly status, there is no financial support for involvement in the program.

## 27. E. The stock parenteral nutrition fluid should have at least 3 g per 80 mL of amino acids.

Extremely low-birth-weight and very low-birth-weight neonates should receive parenteral nutrition immediately after delivery.¹ To expedite this process, stock solutions of parental nutrition need to be available with at least 3 g per 80 mL of amino acids to provide at least 3.5 to 4.0 g/kg/d protein at a volume of 80 to 100 mL/kg/d.² In some cases, this approach will cause the preterm neonate to have a transient increase in the blood urea nitrogen concentration (typically not exceeding 50 mg/dL) that is well tolerated in the absence of renal disease or a metabolic disorder.³ These preterm neonates also require 3 g/kg/d of lipids and 5 to 6 mg/kg/min of glucose, which can be started on the day of birth. Most centers administer 20% lipid solutions because the lower 10% lipid solutions were associated with increased serum triglyceride levels.⁴

## 28. C. Gastric residuals contain nutrients, gastric acid, and enzymes that are likely beneficial for gastrointestinal motility and development.

Assessment of gastric residual volume in preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit had previously been a common practice. However, many units have discontinued this practice because of the following:

- Lack of uniform standards
- Association with discontinuation or delay in feedings leading to a longer period of parenteral nutrition
- Lack of reliability because volume depends on neonate position, feeding tube size, and tip location within the stomach
- Potential injury to fragile stomach mucosa
- Removal of fluid that contains nutrients, gastric acid, and enzymes that are likely beneficial for gastrointestinal motility and development

Although some studies suggest that an increase in gastric residual volumes is an early sign of necrotizing enterocolitis, other studies have not supported this association. Most studies have found that the color of the gastric residual is not an indicator of necrotizing enterocolitis. On the basis of the current available data, the neonate in this vignette should continue with gastric feedings.

29. E. Using the definition of hypertriglyceridemia in adults, the prevalence of a triglyceride concentration of 150 mg/dL or greater is between 6% and 30%.

Hypertriglyceridemia in the adult is defined as a triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL or greater (≥ 1.7 mmol/L). Preterm neonates who are receiving intravenous lipid solutions have a reported hypertriglyceridemia prevalence of 6% to 30%, with greater risk in neonates of younger gestational age and lower birth weight.¹² However, the clinical relevance of this elevation in triglyceride levels is uncertain.

Preterm neonates who received fish oil-based lipid solutions soon after birth had higher triglyceride levels than did neonates who received soybean oil lipid solutions.³ Intralipid (100% soybean oil base) is a lipid solution approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in preterm neonates.

Pasteurization of donor milk eliminates HIV and cytomegalovirus. However, this process can reduce the amount and activity of important immunological components, including secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin, and lysozymes, compared with those in mother's own milk.¹ In addition, donor milk has lower energy content after pasteurization than does raw milk.² Pasteurization techniques do not alter human milk oligosaccharides, which may be important for gastrointestinal protection.³

31. D. The increase in parathyroid hormone concentration on the first day after birth can be blunted in preterm neonates who receive intravenous infusion of calcium.

Early hypocalcemia of prematurity is an exaggerated decrease in serum calcium concentration that occurs in preterm neonates after birth. Bolus or continuous intravenous calcium administration leads to an acute increase in serum calcium levels in affected preterm neonates, but the short- and long-term benefits of this increase are unknown. However, this increase is transient, and treated neonates have similar calcium levels 24 hours after treatment compared with levels in untreated control neonates. Treatment can also blunt the increase in parathyroid hormone concentration that occurs on the first day after birth. The use of total parenteral nutrition with a higher calcium concentration during this period is impractical because calcium phosphate crystals can precipitate in the catheters.

32. A. Advancing her feedings by 4 mL per feeding daily, as opposed to 2 mL per feeding, is more likely to lead to decreased overall parenteral nutrition use without an increase in risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.

Many studies have attempted to decipher the ideal approach to providing enteral nutrition to preterm neonates. Randomized controlled trials have found that preterm neonates who received a faster feeding advancement (30 mL/kg/d compared with 15-20 mL/kg/d) achieved full feedings earlier, had shorter hospital stays, and required a shorter period to regain birth weight without a greater risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.¹²

In comparisons of the types of feeding tube, a nasogastric tube is associated with an increased number of desaturations during insertion and feedings than is an orogastric tube.³ A 2011 Cochrane review⁴ did not find any differences in time to achieve full-volume feedings or growth when comparing bolus versus continuous feedings. However, studies have suggested that continuous feedings may be associated with an increased risk of apnea in very low-birth-weight neonates.⁵ Consistently, studies have found that preterm neonates benefit most from receiving fortified breast milk instead of formula or parenteral nutrition.

33. B. If available, lipid solutions containing predominantly omega-3 fatty acids, and a lesser amount of omega-6 fatty acids or none at all, may provide an alternative source of lipid nutrition that may minimize liver disease.

In the United States, Intralipid is the primary commercial product used to provide lipids to neonates. This is a soybean-based oil with a high amount of omega-6 fatty acids (eg, linoleic acid) and phytosterols; this latter component is associated with cholestasis.¹ Other potential lipid emulsions being explored for commercial use contain fish oil, which has a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids (eg, docosahexaenoic acid) that may minimize the risk of liver disease.² A prolonged period of lipid infusion (&gt;2 weeks) can increase the risk of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.³ If a neonate who is receiving a lipid solution develops cholestasis, the lipid solution should be decreased, while protein and/or glucose supplementation should be increased to avoid caloric deprivation.⁴

If a preterm neonate without renal disease or a metabolic disorder has an increase in blood urea nitrogen, the supplemental protein does not need to be adjusted if the value is less than 50 mg/dL because this is well tolerated and usually transient.⁵

34. C. The current intravenous and enteral nutritional approaches in preterm neonates are unable to achieve intrauterine accretion rates of LCPUFAs.

Multiple studies have shown that postnatal nutritional strategies for preterm neonates are unable to achieve the intrauterine accretion rates of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).¹,² The soybean-based Intralipid emulsion contains high amounts of linoleic acid (LA) but smaller amounts of LCPUFAs. When this lipid solution is administered in preterm neonates in the first week after birth, neonates' levels of LA increase with a decrease in DHA¹; these disturbances persist for more than 1 month despite enteral interventions. Even if DHA is administered enterally, preterm neonates have absorption rates of 70% to 80% and inefficient ability for hydrolysis of lipids.³

these studies have distinct feeding practices, both in use of mother's own milk and feeding advancement, as well as NEC determination, 2 of the multisite studies showed a significant reduction in NEC associated with use of donor human milk.¹² The single-site study that augmented mother's own milk with donor milk or formula did not show a decrease in NEC rates,³ perhaps suggesting that a minimal amount of donor milk is needed to confer benefit.⁴ Additional randomized trials are needed, however, because these studies had a wide range of NEC rates in the formula-fed group (5.3% to 20.0%).

## 36. D. Lipids

The creamatoctr technique can estimate the amount of lipids and calories in human milk.¹ This procedure can be helpful to assess whether a preterm neonate's poor weight gain is related to low lipid and caloric amounts in fresh mother's milk or if the process of storage or handling of the milk decreases the content. The creamatoctr technique can also assess the variability of lipid content in human milk within a single pumping,² between mothers,³ and within 1 day in a single mother.⁴

## 39. A. Antibiotic effect after proteolysis to lactoferricin

Lactoferrin is the most common whey protein in human milk. In the stomach, pepsin assists with the proteolysis of lactoferrin, which produces lactoferricin, a microbicide.¹ Lactoferricin assists with the direct destruction of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.¹² The use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors could interfere with the pepsin-induced proteolysis of lactoferrin.³

40. E. Most phosphorus absorption occurs through active and passive transport in the jejunum.

Phosphorus is absorbed in the jejunum through both active and passive transport. Very low-birth-weight newborns can absorb almost all of the phosphorus in human milk. Although this population has a high rate of phosphorus absorption with ingestion of most formulas, soy-based formulas are associated with a decrease in phosphorus absorption because of phytate binding. Milk derived from mothers who have given birth preterm does not have any extra phosphorus to assist with the phosphorus deficit found in preterm newborns. Thus, preterm newborns require human milk fortifiers to achieve sufficient phosphorus intake.¹

42. E. The patient can now start enteral feedings at 10 to 20 mL/kg/d with maternal breast milk, with addition of donor human if there is not yet enough maternal breast milk.

Mother's own milk is the ideal type of milk to provide to preterm neonates. If this is not available or volumes are inadequate, donor milk is recommended for neonates with a birth weight less than 1,500 g or birth gestational age younger than 32 weeks.¹,² If donor milk or mother's own milk is not available, enteral feedings should not be withheld beyond 1 day after birth because data from animal studies suggest that intestinal villous atrophy might occur without feedings.³ Once very low-birth-weight or extremely low-birth-weight neonates are receiving full-volume feedings, caloric fortification is recommended to maximize growth and bone density.⁴

43. D. The initiation of MEN within the first 2 to 4 days after delivery, as opposed to later, may result in decreased parenteral nutrition use, increased weight gain, and earlier attainment of full enteral feedings.

Minimal enteral nutrition (MEN), also known as trophic feeding or nonnutritive nutrition, provides 12 to 24 mL/kg/d of feedings.¹ Studies in preterm pigs have shown the following benefits¹,²:

- Prevention of intestinal atrophy
- Stimulation of gastrointestinal development
- Improvement of gut motility
- Greater activity of digestive enzymes

In humans, evidence for use of MEN is disparate, with some studies showing improved weight gain, fewer complications from parenteral nutrition, and shorter time to attain full feedings.³,⁴ However, a Cochrane review⁵ showed lack of benefit of MEN, although available studies lacked consistent definitions of MEN, type of diet, and duration of MEN.

## 44. E. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all breastfed or partially breastfed neonates receive 400 IU of vitamin D daily.

Most preterm neonates have increased alkaline phosphatase levels (400–600 IU/L) at the time of discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all neonates who are receiving breast milk, regardless of birth gestational age, be supplemented with 400 IU of vitamin D.¹

Pediatric care providers should monitor the growth of former preterm neonates. As with term neonates, use of human milk is preferred. However, breastfeeding may need to be limited because additional calories added to pumped breast milk may be necessary to improve growth. Some former preterm neonates require hydrolyzed formula, and most of these neonates can transition to term formula at age 12 to 24 months.

## 45. A. The cord blood magnesium concentration is higher than the maternal magnesium concentration, reflecting active placental transport of magnesium.

In utero, transplacental transfer of magnesium occurs by means of active transport; the fetal magnesium concentration is higher than the maternal magnesium concentration. Magnesium is distributed mostly in the bone (65%), followed by intracellular muscle and soft tissues (34%). Magnesium is maintained primarily in the ionized form in the serum (62%).¹ Serum concentrations are maintained in a narrow range, which is balanced by the amount of gastrointestinal absorption (40% of ingested magnesium is absorbed), the renal absorption (mostly in the proximal tubule in neonates), and the renal excretion rates.²,³

## 46. B. Although there is a theoretical concern of free fatty acids competing for albumin binding sites leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, the actual risk in preterm neonates is likely to be minimal because molar ratios of 4:1 to 5:1 of free fatty acids to albumin are required for significant changes in bilirubin binding.

The amount and method of advancement of lipid emulsions in preterm neonates during the first few days after birth varies widely, but generally, most neonatal intensive care units aim to achieve a maximum total of 3 to 4 g/kg/d.¹ The most common solution used in the United States for preterm neonates, Intralipid, consists of 100% soybean oil. Studies have not shown any significant clinical increase in serum concentrations of unbound bilirubin in preterm neonates who are receiving lipid emulsions.² In autopsy specimens of preterm neonates who have received intravenous lipids, lipid droplets are typically found in the lungs.³ The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

## 48. C. In growing preterm neonates, the percentage of intestinal absorption of calcium is between 50% and 60% of intake.

Most fetal calcium accretion occurs during the third trimester, with term neonates accumulating approximately 25 to 30 g of calcium. Unfortunately, postnatal delivery of calcium either enterally or parenterally is inadequate at achieving the intrauterine accretion rate of calcium.¹ After birth, preterm neonates are able to absorb only approximately 50% to 60% of ingested calcium.² The amount of calcium intake required in preterm neonates is approximately twice that of phosphorus needs.

## 53. C. The American Academy of Pediatrics supports the use of pasteurized donor human milk as a safe alternative if mother's own milk is not available.

Although mother's own milk is the preferred feeding choice in preterm neonates, pasteurized donor human milk is a safe alternative.¹ Donor milk is recommended to decrease the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm neonates if mother's own milk is not available or is insufficient during the first 30 days after birth until a postmenstrual age of 34-weeks' gestation.² However, additional larger-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the benefit of donor milk in reducing the risk of NEC, as shown in some studies. Donor human milk has been associated with slower growth than have other feeding alternatives.

## 54. D. Neonates receiving fish oil-based emulsions were able to achieve higher docosahexaenoic acid levels than were those receiving nonfish oil-based emulsions, although the immediate decrease in levels after birth was not prevented.

Intralipids contains only soybean as the source of oil, whereas newer lipid emulsions available outside the United States contain other types of oil, including nonfish (eg, olive, safflower, coconut, olive) and fish oils.¹² Studies about this newer generation of lipid emulsions are limited, but data suggest that their use is associated with a lower risk of chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity, and cholestasis. A few studies have examined the effect of these new lipid emulsions on fatty acid profiles and found that patients receiving fish oil-based lipid emulsions had higher docosahexaenoic acid levels, a lower postnatal decrease in arachidonic acid, and an increase in eicosapentaenoic acid levels than did patients receiving nonfish oil-based lipids.³⁴ Of note, alternate intravenous lipid formulations are now available in the United States. Omegaven, a 100% fish oil triglyceride emulsion, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in neonates with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease. Furthermore, while not approved by the FDA for use in neonates, Smoflipid, which is composed of soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil, is now also available in the United States and used in some neonatal intensive care units.

Studies in preterm pigs have shown that minimal enteral nutrition, also known as trophic feeding or nonnutritive nutrition, enhances intestinal motility, improves intestinal structure, increases digestive enzyme activity, and promotes migrating motor activity.¹ Studies suggest that trophic feedings decrease intestinal atrophy.¹² There have been no reports of an association of trophic feedings with necrotizing enterocolitis or ileal strictures.

## 56. E. The oral skills and feeding readiness of preterm neonates should be evaluated throughout hospitalization because early interventions can affect feeding outcomes.

Preterm neonates younger than 32-weeks' postmenstrual age should not be fed orally because they lack the ability to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing.¹ As the neonate gets older, these physiologic processes mature, and feeding coordination begins at 34- to 36-weeks' gestational age. Preterm neonates need to be assessed regularly to determine when feeding should be initiated and advanced. Early interventions, such as early introduction of small amounts of oral feedings by breast or bottle and tactile and kinesthetic sensorimotor stimulation, can affect feeding outcomes.² Although a Cochrane review³ showed that cup feeding increased the chances of having some amount of breastfeeding at the time of discharge, it led to a longer period of hospitalization.

57. C. Having a donor human milk feeding practice in the neonatal intensive care unit has been associated with increased rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge.

Studies have found that a donor human milk feeding practice for preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit does not decrease mother's own milk¹ and leads to higher rates of providing exclusive mother's own milk at discharge.² However, there are challenges with using donor milk. For example, neonate growth can be poor because the donated milk typically is obtained from women who are lactating beyond 6 months when the nutrient concentration is lower.³ The amount of protein and zinc are lower in donor human milk than in mother's own milk.⁴

Donor milk needs to be pasteurized and tested for infections before use. As a result of this approach, there has not been a known transmission reported in the United States with use of banked donor milk. In contrast, milk sharing or purchasing milk via the Internet has been associated with infectious risks.⁵,⁶

Rickets or fractures occur more commonly in preterm neonates of younger gestational age and those with a higher level of acuity. These complications are found in 10% to 32% of neonates with a birth weight less than 1,500 g and up to 60% of neonates with a birth weight less than 1,000 g. Preterm neonates with a birth weight less than 1,500 g should receive 200 to 400 IU/d, and neonates with a birth weight less than 1,000 g should receive 400 IU/d; higher doses of 2,000 IU/d do not affect the incidence of osteopenia in this population.¹ Most preterm neonates have not "caught up" in terms of bone mineralization by the time of discharge home.

The physical examination is not helpful in the diagnosis of osteopenia of prematurity and rickets in preterm neonates. Rather, the diagnosis is typically made after routine radiography showing severely deficient bone mineralization and healing and/or new fractures. Neonates with osteopenia of prematurity typically have the following laboratory abnormalities:

- Normal serum calcium
- Low or normal serum phosphorus
- Normal or increased alkaline phosphorus
- Normal or increased parathyroid hormone
- Normal or increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
- Increased renal excretion of calcium
- Increased renal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus

## 61. E. Toll-like receptors

Ingestion of human milk promotes growth of commensal bacteria. These organisms attach to toll-like receptors, preventing pathogenic bacteria from binding. The binding of commensal organisms to these receptors leads to a decrease in nuclear factor κβ activation, which prevents neutrophil entry into the intestines.¹ In contrast, ingestion of formula increases pathogenic intestinal bacteria, which is associated with enhanced intestinal inflammation.

## 62. D. Initial infusion rate, 4 to 6 mg/kg/min; daily increment, 1 to 2 mg/kg/min; maximal rate, 12 mg/kg/min

Preterm neonates require sufficient glucose supplementation because this carbohydrate is the primary source of energy for the brain. Preterm neonates have poor glucose production as a result of limited glycogen stores and have high glucose requirements because of highly metabolic organs.¹ In preterm neonates receiving parenteral nutrition, the most appropriate initial rate of glucose is 4 to 6 mg/kg/min (sometimes limited to 4 mg/kg/min in extremely low-birth-weight neonates) with a daily rate of increase of 1 to 2 mg/kg/min, up to a maximal rate of 12 mg/kg/min.²

The newly identified anti-inflammatory mediators resolvin D1 and protectin D1 are most likely to be derived from docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n-3).

## 64. E. Vitamin D

The primary factor in the development of bone disease of prematurity is vitamin D deficiency. Severe vitamin D deficiency in preterm neonates can be evident by severe bone abnormalities, seizures in the setting of hypocalcemia, failure to thrive, neurological abnormalities, and an increased number of respiratory infections.

## 65. C. 1,000 mOsm/L

Peripherally infused parenteral nutrition solutions have an osmolarity tolerance that ranges from 700 to 1,000 mOsm/L. Osmolarity depends on the amino acid, glucose, sodium, and phosphorus concentrations. It is calculated by using the following equation¹:

$$
\text{Osmolarity} = (\text{amino acid} \times 8) + (\text{glucose} \times 7) + (\text{sodium} \times 2) + (\text{phosphorus} \times 0.2) - 50
$$

Amino acid concentration is in grams per liter (g/L), glucose concentration is in grams per liter (g/L), sodium is in milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), and phosphorus is in milligrams per liter (mg/L).

Although Holder pasteurization is effective at eliminating bacterial and viral pathogens in donor human milk, this process also affects the nutritional content of the milk. Freezing and pasteurization eliminates all immunoglobulin M, lipoprotein lipase, and bile salt-activated lipase. $^{1}$ In contrast, freezing and pasteurization do not affect the levels of linoleic acid, free fatty acids, or monoglycerides. $^{1}$ Immunoglobulin A and G levels are decreased slightly.

## 72. C. 400 mcg/d

In 1992, the US Public Health Service recommended daily folic acid intake of 400 mcg/d for all women of childbearing potential. However, surveys have shown that only approximately 30% of women aged 18 to 45 years adhere to this guideline. Furthermore, approximately one-half of primary care providers in the United States discuss the importance of folic acid supplementation with their patients of reproductive age. To address this lack of adherence, the US Food and Drug Administration mandated fortification of grain products with folic acid by 1998. Since this mandate, the incidence of neural tube defects has decreased.¹ Concerns have been raised about the potential negative effects of fortification as a result of possible epigenetic changes that might have long-lasting effects, although there are no data to support this concern.

## 73. E. Preterm gestation

There is a misconception that mothers of very low-birth-weight or extremely low-birth-weight neonates are unable to provide adequate amounts of breast milk to their neonates. Although these women are at increased risk for a delay in lactogenesis and may have stress-related lactation issues, preterm birth itself does not cause insufficient milk volumes.¹⁻³ The main reason for the association of preterm birth with insufficient milk volume is that mothers have inadequate information, equipment, and resources during the first 2 weeks after delivery.⁴

## 76. B. Cue-based feeding

There are different interventions or feeding strategies that can be used when transitioning a preterm neonate from gastric to oral feedings.¹ If a neonate has clinical instability during feedings, interventions such as cue-based feedings, slow-flow nipples, and pacing may help to establish more stable feedings. For neonates with difficulty latching or maintaining a seal, a nipple shield, proper head support, and proper positioning are helpful. Neonates with a disorganized sucking, swallowing, and breathing sequence may benefit from swaddling to assist with state regulation, cue-based feedings, and pacing. Strategies to assist neonates who have poor endurance during feeding include limiting the length of feedings, providing cue-based feeding, and pacing.

## 77. B. 2 weeks

Initiation of iron supplementation at 2.0 mg/kg/d in low-birth-weight neonates at 2 weeks of age leads to improved iron status at 3 to 6 months of age compared with results in neonates who received iron supplementation only if they developed an iron deficiency.¹ When iron supplementation was initiated at 2 weeks of age instead of 4 weeks of age, neonates had improved iron status at 1 and 2 months of age.²

1.  B. In utero immunoglobulin treatment

The mechanism of injury in gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) is thought to be immune mediated, with maternal antibodies crossing the placenta and binding to fetal hepatocyte cell surface antigens, injuring the fetal liver.¹ If pregnant women whose previous pregnancies were affected by GALD received weekly intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, the risk of clinical manifestations of GALD was low in future pregnancies.²

7. C. Maternal alloimmune disorder affecting the fetus

Gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) has an atypical inheritance pattern, with the following features:

- Sporadic occurrence, with unaffected offspring before affected neonates
- High recurrence rate (80%–90%)
- Women having affected neonates but lacking female siblings who have affected neonates
- Women having affected neonates from different male parentage
- Lack of affected neonates of same father with different female parentage

On the basis of this pattern, Whittington and Hibbard¹ hypothesized that GALD may be an immune-mediated disorder of maternal alloimmune antibodies directed against a fetal antigen. Animal models and clinical studies of immunoglobulin therapy have supported this hypothesis.²,³

The recurrence rate of gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) in the progeny of sensitized women is approximately 80% to 90%. Prenatal treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can alleviate disease severity for GALD. A recommended regimen for women with a history of a previously affected fetus consists of 1 g/kg of IVIG (maximum 60 g) administered at 14 weeks, 16 weeks, and weekly from 18 weeks of gestation until the end of the pregnancy. This regimen has led to decreased rates of pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and severity of liver disease in neonates with GALD.

14. B. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is differentiated from gastroesophageal reflux when there are signs or symptoms such as significant discomfort, poor weight gain, esophagitis, or airway symptoms.

Gastroesophageal reflux is the physiological passage of gastric contents into the esophagus and is a naturally occurring process seen in all age groups as a result of transient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. All newborns have some degree of reflux, including healthy newborns who may have 3 to 5 reflux events occurring each hour. A newborn may be considered to have gastroesophageal reflux disease when reflux of gastric contents causes clinical signs such as significant discomfort, poor weight gain, esophagitis, or airway symptoms.

16. E. The urinary intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) level is 5 times higher than the high-range value of 2.20 pg/nmol of creatinine; because I-FABP levels may indicate disease severity, this increases your suspicion that this neonate may have severe NEC and leads you to pursue follow-up tests and treatment.

I-FABP is a cytosolic water-soluble protein released from mature enterocytes when cell membrane integrity is compromised. I-FABP passes the glomerular filter and can be detected in the urine quickly. Urinary I-FABP levels are higher in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) than in neonates without NEC. Levels may also correlate with severity of disease.¹

For neonates with biliary atresia, the rate of success in reestablishing bile flow depends on the age of the neonate when the hepatic portoenterostomy is performed, with a goal of surgery before age 30 to 45 days.¹⁻³ If jaundice successfully clears after the portoenterostomy, the 10-year transplant-free survival rate ranges from 75% to 90%; however, if significant jaundice persists, the 3-year transplant-free survival rate is 20%.⁴

21. A. Because there are several biologically plausible mechanisms for human milk's role in the prevention of NEC, such as antigen-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins, as well as multiple observational studies demonstrating a protective effect compared with the effects of infant formula, mother's own milk is the preferred feeding choice for this neonate.

Protective bioactive factors in human milk include antigen-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins, leukocytes, enzymes, lactoferrin, growth factors, oligosaccharides, and polyunsaturated fatty acids.¹ The levels of many of these bioactive factors are reduced after pasteurization, such as would be the case for donor human milk. Human milk also promotes intestinal colonization with good organisms, including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and from the prebiotic effect of the large component of oligosaccharides.²

22. E. Trophic enteral feedings can be started when gastric output via the orogastric tube decreases.

Although there may be some variation in practice, neonates with gastroschisis almost always have some degree of ileus postoperatively, which is often prolonged.¹,² Therefore, parenteral nutrition is initiated early. Enteral feeding can be initiated early in the postnatal and postoperative periods. A common strategy is to wait until gastric tube output decreases and then titrate feedings to meet caloric requirements as tolerated. Because prolonged ileus is frequently seen with gastroschisis, it is probably not worthwhile to perform a study to evaluate for mechanical obstruction, such as a small bowel contrast study, until the neonate is approximately 6 weeks old.

Glucagon-like peptide-2 is an antisecretory hormone that regulates intestinal transit. It is considered 1 of the most important hormones in intestinal adaptation.¹,² Glucagon-like peptide-2 is secreted by L cells in the terminal ileum and colon and increases intestinal blood flow. In patients who have short bowel syndrome and retain their colon, glucagon-like peptide-2 levels are elevated.³

25. B. Epidemiologic studies have shown associations between cesarean delivery and allergic, autoimmune disease; however, further studies are needed to clarify the potential for confounding factors such as maternal antibiotic use before delivery and nutritional factors.

There have been concurrent trends of increasing cesarean delivery and autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, multiple sclerosis, and allergic diseases.¹² Because it is more likely that pregnant women who undergo cesarean delivery may receive antibiotics, and other confounding factors may be associated with mode of delivery, further research may help to elucidate the potential mechanisms for these risk factors for neonatal and long-term outcomes.

26. D. The posterior sagittal approach is the preferred approach for separating the gastrointestinal tract from the reproductive and urinary tracts.

For cloacal repair, a key principle is separation of the gastrointestinal tract from the reproductive and urinary tracts. Posterior sagittal anorectoplasty is the standard approach for this repair. A laparoscopic approach has also been described.¹ Vaginoscopy and cystoscopy are performed before reconstruction. The gastrointestinal tract is separated and adequately mobilized down to the center of the sphincter complex. Although there also had been a strategy to separate the urinary and reproductive systems, this procedure was difficult and often led to postoperative complications. Thus, an alternative approach is to mobilize the urogenital sinus as a unit.²

Ultrasonography allows for antenatal diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and most cases are identified prenatally.¹² Right-sided lesions can be more difficult to diagnose antenatally because the herniated viscera consist predominantly of the liver, which has echogenicity similar to that of the lung. Findings that may suggest CDH include polyhydramnios, small abdominal circumference, abnormal cardiac axis, and mediastinal shift.

For term neonates (similar to adults), intestinal motor activity during fasting is characterized by periods of quiescence (phase 1), irregular activity (phase 2), and regular phasic propagating activity (phase 3). However, preterm neonates have clusters of low-amplitude nonpropagating pressure waves in phase 3.¹

Okamoto et al¹ described a prognostic system for patients with esophageal atresia, which had been revised from the Spitz classification, with categories of weight and congenital heart disease as indicators of risk. Major cardiac anomaly was identified as the most influential factor for survival. The classifications are as follows:

- Class I represents low risk in patients without cardiac defect and with weight greater than 2,000 g, having a survival rate of 100%.
- Class II represents patients with weight less than 2,000 g, having a survival rate of 82%.

Alagille syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder, occurring in approximately 1 in 70,000 live births. Almost all patients with Alagille syndrome have a mutation in the JAGGED 1 gene that encodes a ligand in the Notch signaling pathway. Patients have a combination of neonatal cholestasis and bile duct paucity. Other features include congenital heart disease, with peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis being the most common lesion, dysmorphic facies, butterfly vertebrae, ocular posterior embryotoxon, renal anomalies, vascular abnormalities (including intracranial lesions in up to 12% of patients), and short stature.¹,²

Laparotomy with resection of necrotic bowel and enterostomy formation has been a traditional surgical approach to necrotizing enterocolitis.¹ Advantages of this approach include elimination of the source of sepsis and reducing the risk of an anastomotic leak of ischemic bowel into inflamed areas. However, there are disadvantages; there can be risk of high stoma output and salt and water loss. Other complications of stomata include retraction, stricture, prolapse, obstruction, and wound issues.²

Gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) should be suspected in neonates with signs of severe liver disease and in unexplained cases of fetal death in the late second or third trimester. Suspicion for GALD may be higher when maternal history includes consecutive pregnancies resulting in fetal death or neonatal liver failure.¹

A liver biopsy in an affected neonate will typically demonstrate hepatocyte necrosis without collapse, fibrosis, or inflammation, with or without siderosis in the liver or other tissues.

CDH is a prominent feature of Fryns syndrome, for which a diaphragmatic defect serves as 1 of the primary diagnostic criteria. The presence of other anomalies or associated syndromes increases the mortality risk.²

Transient lower esophageal relaxation occurs naturally throughout the day in all age groups.¹ Neonates with gastroesophageal reflux disease, having more symptoms such as poor weight gain, are likely to have the same number of these episodes of transient relaxation as do those without disease; however, these episodes allow reflux with greater frequency in these patients. Most neonates with reflux do not have esophagitis, and a large proportion of reflux events are nonacid.²

40. B. PHTN in the presence of CDH has a worse prognosis than does PHTN alone.

Pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) is 1 of the most important prognostic factors in the survival of patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH); studies have shown that PHTN in the presence of CDH confers a worse prognosis than does PHTN alone. Unlike in patients with isolated PHTN, inhaled nitric oxide does not appear to have a meaningful clinical effect on PHTN in patients with CDH. Patients with PHTN and CDH have a slightly increased risk of requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation when they receive inhaled nitric oxide.[1,2]

There are 2 components of PHTN in CDH. One is a structural or fixed component due to pulmonary hypoplasia. The second is a reversible component due to several factors: imbalanced innervation of the smooth muscles, increased reactivity to noxious stimuli, ventilator-induced lung injury, metabolic derangements, and decreased response to vasodilators.³

Along with initial respiratory and circulatory stabilization, neonates with gastroschisis should have the intestinal structures protected with moist dressings or protective covering. Segments of necrosis or perforation will warrant immediate surgery. Primary anastomosis will not typically be attempted in the presence of ongoing inflammation. Identified atretic segments are often left untouched at this stage. If the peritoneal cavity will accommodate, the eviscerated structures may be reduced, stomata are created if necessary, and the abdomen can be closed.[1-4]

44. D. Reduce manganese and copper in the parenteral nutrition solution and monitor levels.

Neonates who receive prolonged courses of parenteral nutrition are at risk for developing liver injury and cholestasis.¹ Enteral feedings stimulate bile flow, gallbladder contraction, and intestinal motility. Even trophic feedings can be beneficial in reducing the degree of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. If parenteral nutrition is continued in the presence of cholestasis, manganese and copper should be reduced and plasma levels monitored because these metals can accumulate to toxic levels in the cholestatic liver.

45. B. Although there is not a uniform approach to treatment, some potential initial options for management are resection of necrotic bowel with proximal diversion, or proximal diversion without resection followed by delayed second-look surgery.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) totalis refers to widespread disease, with less than 25% of bowel being viable. It is unclear whether there are specific risk factors for NEC totalis beyond those for NEC in general.¹ Treatment options are limited; typically, all necrotic bowel tissues are resected, and a proximal diversion is created. Another option may be initial proximal diversion without resection followed by a delayed second-look surgery at 6 to 8 weeks after initial surgery.²,³ Mortality and morbidity are high; almost all survivors of NEC totalis have short bowel syndrome and long-term parenteral nutrition dependence.

46. C. Salivary gland biopsy

The diagnosis of gestational alloimmune liver disease requires an extrahepatic source of siderosis. Because affected patients usually have severe coagulopathy, salivary gland biopsy is preferred over liver biopsy because it offers a more specific and safer method of diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful because it can show abnormal iron distribution in multiple organs in the majority of cases. Iron deposition is seen in darkened areas of the liver, pancreas, salivary glands, and adrenal glands, with lower T2-weighted signal intensity. This is in contrast to the spleen, which has a greater T2-weighted signal intensity because iron is not deposited in the reticuloendothelial system.¹

Radiologic tests for gastroesophageal reflux disease have limitations. An upper gastrointestinal tract series can detect anatomic abnormalities but may not be able to discriminate between physiologic and nonphysiologic gastroesophageal reflux episodes. The test may have poor sensitivity compared with that of pH studies. $^{1}$  Scintigraphy can be used to detect reflux, but there is a lack of standardization and age-specific data. $^{2}$  Endoscopy allows visualization and biopsy of the esophagus and can reveal the presence of esophagitis. However, it is a relatively invasive procedure. Furthermore, there is poor correlation between reflux symptoms and the presence of esophagitis diagnosed with endoscopy. $^{3}$

LHR, as measured with ultrasonography, is the most widely validated marker of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) severity. It is most reliable between 22 and 26 weeks of gestation. An observed-to-expected LHR is used as the LHR changes over gestation. $^{1}$  An observed-to-expected LHR less than  $25\%$  is associated with less than  $30\%$  survival, whereas an observed-to-expected LHR greater than  $46\%$  is associated with more than  $85\%$  survival. $^{2}$

After feeding, blood flow to the superior mesenteric artery increases, reaching a peak at 45 minutes, and then returning to preprandial levels in 3 hours. $^{1,2}$  Greater increases in postprandial blood flow in preterm neonates are associated with less intestinal dysmotility and better feeding tolerance. $^{3,4}$  Growth-restricted preterm neonates have less increase in superior mesenteric artery blood flow in response to the first feeding. $^{5}$

53. A. Although an esophagram may be obtained, it is not mandatory before initiation of feedings, and omission of the study rarely influences clinical management.

Although it is a common practice, an esophagram after repair of esophageal atresia (EA) is not a requirement because the study rarely influences clinical management.¹ Initiation of enteral feedings is generally recommended at approximately day 7 postoperatively.

There has been no definitive benefit demonstrated with prolonged intubation after EA repair. Such a practice can lead to other complications. After extubation, continuous positive pressure ventilation should be used with caution to avoid increased pressure on the anastomosis.

Although there are some preferences for cesarean delivery and/or induced preterm delivery for women with a fetus with an omphalocele, there is no clear evidence that cesarean delivery improves neonatal outcomes.¹ Initial treatment of a neonate with an omphalocele includes respiratory stabilization and protection of the exposed viscera or omphalocele sac. There are several options for protection, including covering with saline-soaked dressings and/or placement of a bowel bag to limit insensible fluid and heat losses.²,³

Gastroschisis is most often sporadic and is associated with young maternal age and maternal smoking, alcohol use, illicit substance abuse, and use of over-the-counter vasoactive medications. However, familial cases have been reported. Multiple genes have been implicated in gastroschisis, including those encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and atrial natriuretic peptide. Polymorphisms within these genes are associated with a nearly 2-fold risk of gastroschisis; this risk is greater for smoking mothers.¹

Inter-alpha inhibitor proteins are serine protease inhibitors and acute-phase reactants that downregulate endogenous serine proteases that can contribute to epithelial cell necrosis and potentially to necrotizing enterocolitis.¹ These proteins are generally found in high concentrations in human plasma but are decreased in conditions such as sepsis. Newborns with necrotizing enterocolitis have lower inter-alpha inhibitor protein levels than do those without necrotizing enterocolitis.²

Neonates who receive prolonged courses of parenteral nutrition are at risk for developing liver injury and cholestasis.¹ Growth failure is common secondary to impaired absorption of fats. The caloric intake should be approximately 125% of the recommended dietary allowance. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) should be supplemented in neonates with cholestasis. Vitamin supplementation should be continued for at least 3 months after resolution of jaundice.

Trials have shown that transpyloric feeding may effectively decrease apnea and bradycardia events in some preterm neonates.¹

Right-sided positioning may speed gastric emptying and thus decreases stomach contents. However, there may also be a deleterious effect of increasing episodes of lower esophageal relaxation, which cause an increase in reflux events.

## 72. B. Citrulline

Citrulline is produced almost exclusively by enterocytes. Plasma citrulline concentrations are reduced in patients with short bowel syndrome. Changes in plasma concentrations of citrulline may reflect intestinal adaptation and potentially distinguish patients who have transient from those who have permanent intestinal failure.¹ In children with short bowel syndrome, citrulline levels can help estimate the amount of enteral calories that patients can tolerate without developing diarrhea.² Citrulline has been proposed as a marker of enterocyte mass and short bowel function.³ Sequential measurement of citrulline may be able to indicate progress in bowel adaptation.

GENETICS AND INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM

1.  A. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

Preclinical animal data indicate that alterations in gene imprinting occur before implantation in embryos cultured in vitro. Furthermore, assisted reproductive technology (ART) has been associated with an increased risk of genomic imprinting disorders in humans. $^{1,2}$ In a recent meta-analysis, strong positive associations were noted between ART and imprinting disorders of maternal origin (Beckwith-Wiedemann and Angelman syndromes), as well as, to a lesser extent, paternal origin (Prader-Willi and Silver-Russell syndromes). Among those, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome had the strongest association. In a recent epidemiological study in Italy, a 10-fold increase in the risk of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome was noted after use of ART. $^{3}$ At this time, it remains unclear whether the procedure itself and/or the underlying infertility disorder are involved in this process.

The Barlow test is 1 of the maneuvers performed during the examination of the hip joint in neonates. With the neonate's hip flexed to a 90° angle and the sacrum stabilized, the examiner exerts gentle posterior and anterior traction (push and pull) to assess femoral head movement. A sensation of posterior movement and relocation on gentle anterior traction indicates subluxation. This physical examination finding is 1 of the most useful signs of developmental dysplasia of the hip along with asymmetric lie and limited abduction. $^{1}$

Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is rare, occurring in 1 in 200,000 neonates, and manifests within the first month after birth, with resolution of symptoms typically between 3 and 6 months of age. Neonates with TNDM classically present with intrauterine growth restriction, failure to thrive, hyperglycemia, and dehydration at age 4 to 6 weeks. TNDM is now recognized as a disorder of genetic imprinting involving the chromosome 6q24 region.1

7. B. Angelman syndrome

Patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) are not usually recognized in the newborn period but more typically come to medical attention for developmental delays at approximately 6 to 12 months of age. A history of decreased cooing, babbling, and crying, as well as early or frequent smiling and increased hand and foot sucking during infancy, is often discovered retrospectively in these patients. AS is caused by deletions or mutations of the maternally inherited gene UBE3A on chromosome 15q11-q13. Deletions occur in 68% of patients with AS, and paternal uniparental disomy occurs in 7% of cases.1,2

The patient in the vignette demonstrates clinical features suggestive of Prader-Willi syndrome, which is a disorder of genomic imprinting caused by absence of paternally inherited imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13. Deletions are most common (65%--75% of cases), followed by maternal uniparental disomy in 20% to 30% of cases, and imprinting defect in 1% to 3% of cases.1

Uniparental disomy can be detected with single nucleotide polymorphism microarray, which allows for the identification of loss of heterozygosity. This test is helpful when investigating possible genetic disorders in families with a history of consanguinity.1,2

9. A. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an overgrowth syndrome that can manifest in the neonatal period with hypoglycemia, abdominal wall defects, hemihyperplasia, macroglossia, and visceromegaly. BWS is due to epigenetic and genetic alterations on chromosome 11p15.5. This chromosomal region contains 2 imprinting centers (ICs; IC1 and IC2) that are methylated in a parent-of-origin manner. BWS is caused by heterogeneous molecular defects, including loss of methylation of IC2 on the maternal chromosome, paternal uniparental disomy, gain of methylation of maternal chromosome at IC1, and 11p15 paternal duplications. These complex molecular defects all result in an imbalance in the expression of growth inhibitor and growth promotor genes.1,2

Cri du chat syndrome, Williams syndrome, and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome are all caused by deletions of genetic material, whereas Prader-Willi syndrome is a disorder of genomic imprinting secondary to deletion of paternally inherited genes.

10. C. This test can find submicroscopic copy number variations at the chromosomal level, such as deletions or duplications.

A chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) can identify submicroscopic copy number variations (CNVs) at the chromosomal level, such as deletions or duplications. It will detect CNVs that are too small to be detected with traditional G-banded karyotyping. However, results from CMA take longer to receive than do results from karyotyping. Furthermore, CMA may yield CNVs of unclear clinical significance.¹

The discovery that all pregnant women have cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was made in 1997.¹ Current data indicate that 10% to 20% of the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in the maternal plasma is from fetal origin. cffDNA originates from the placenta and is shorter than maternal cfDNA (~150 base pairs compared with 300 base pairs). The cffDNA rapidly clears from the maternal circulation after delivery.²⁻⁵

12. A. In fragile X syndrome, there is a mutation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FRMP) with excessive (&gt; 200) cysteine-guanine-guanine (CGG) trinucleotide repeats, which silences the gene.

Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder affecting the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and thereby the production of FMRP, a protein critical for synaptogenesis. FMRP production is regulated by CGG trinucleotide repeats in the FMR1 gene (normal = 5–40 trinucleotide repeats), as well as methylation of the gene. CGG expansion leads to decreased expression and, in the full form (&gt; 200 repeats), silencing of the FMR1 gene. In the premutation state (55–200 repeats), there is typically no intellectual disability. However, individuals with the full mutation (&gt; 200 repeats) will develop the typical clinical picture of fragile X syndrome.¹

Fragile X syndrome affects more boys than girls: 1 in 8,000 and 1 in 4,000, respectively. Patients most typically present with global developmental delays, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, abnormal temperament, and intellectual disability. The physical features characteristic of fragile X syndrome are typically not identified in the neonatal period and include the following²:

- Long facies with prominent forehead, large occipitofrontal circumference, large ears, and prominent jaw
- Strabismus
- Joint hyperextensibility
- Flat feet
- Macro-orchidism²

13. A. The sample is obtained by means of capillary stick.

The measurement of lactate (lactic acid) levels is a clinically useful test when caring for neonates with shock or who are suspected of having an inborn error of metabolism. Collection technique and specimen handling are important considerations to avoid a spurious increase in lactate levels. For optimal results, the following recommendations should be followed¹:

- Use a free-flowing blood draw
- Avoid tourniquet use
- Do not measure from a draw likely to be hemolyzed (capillary stick, difficult blood draw)
- Place on ice immediately after collection to avoid cell lysis
- Measure as quickly as possible or separate serum or plasma rapidly and freeze for future determination

14. A. Both WES and WGS are subject to challenges in variant interpretation because the large quantity of bases sequenced could lead to more identified variants that require interpretation.

Genomic medicine uses the study of the entire human genome and the 20,000 genes it contains to make clinical decisions. It is a rapidly evolving field that has led to significant changes in clinical practice in recent years. Medical genomic medicine relies on several genomic sequencing techniques, including targeted gene sequencing (Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing [NGS]), whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome sequencing (WGS).¹

WES determines the nucleotide sequence of all protein-coding regions, approximately 1% to 2% of the human genome. Exons are sequenced using NGS and then compared with a reference genome. Variant call formats are identified and genes analyzed for potential pathogenicity. Of note, 3% to 5% of exons fail to be sequenced.¹ Interpretation of gene curation is a complex process because variations between individuals are common. Classifying genes by using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics classification system is recommended.² WES is typically considered in neonates with a constellation of findings not suggestive of a specific syndrome and in whom initial testing has been unrevealing.

Both exons and introns are included in WGS. WGS is rarely used in clinical practice currently. It is more expensive than WES and requires testing of the proband and both parents (trio testing). WGS may be considered in cases in which WES did not yield results.

15. D. Turner syndrome

The phenotype of Turner syndrome, or monosomy X, is a variable phenotype such that some individuals receive the diagnosis in the newborn period, but others do not receive a diagnosis until later in life because of short stature or amenorrhea.

In the neonatal period, Turner syndrome can manifest with the following features¹:

- Low birth weight
- Webbed neck
- Lymphedema of the hands and feet
- Broad chest with wide-spaced nipples
- Congenital heart defects (35% of cases), most commonly bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, valvular aortic stenosis, and mitral valve prolapse

## 26. B. DNA methylation of cytosine of a CpG dinucleotide

Epigenetic mechanisms are critical to gene regulation and result in the switching on or off of genes on the basis of developmental stage and cell-specific needs but also environmental factors. Epigenetic gene regulation is based on complex interactions between the DNA, the transcription machinery, and cofactors.

DNA methylation has emerged as a critical factor in gene regulation and is the best understood epigenetic mechanism. It involves the methylation of a cytosine of a CpG dinucleotide. CpG dinucleotides are present in many promoter regions, and thereby methylation has been shown to be a mechanism of gene silencing. CpG dinucleotides that are present elsewhere in the genome are typically methylated at baseline and regulate promoter function, as well as transcription. $^{1,2}$

## 28. C. Although L-lactate may be present due to tissue hypoxia, there may also be a contribution of D-lactate from increased production by enteric bacteria.

Lactate is a naturally occurring intermediary metabolite that can be used as a marker of end-tissue oxygenation. Increased lactate levels are common in neonates and are caused by a variety of factors, with tissue hypoxia being the most common underlying cause in this population. During tissue hypoxia, lactate levels increase due to dependence on glycolysis for adenosine triphosphate and decreased conversion of lactate to pyruvate. $^{1}$

Lactate elevation during necrotizing enterocolitis is secondary to both tissue necrosis and production of L-lactate, as well as D-lactate production. D-lactate is a lactate isomer produced by enteric bacteria, and most laboratory techniques cannot distinguish between these 2 lactate forms. Therefore, D-lactate production may persist in neonates with short gut syndrome and/or bacterial overgrowth. $^{2,3}$

## 29. B. Short nucleotide adapters are ligated to DNA fragment ends and can include bar codes that allow for identification of an individual's DNA.

Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are both techniques used to determine a specific genetic sequence of the human genome.

Sanger sequencing was described first and relies on hybridization of the DNA region of interest by using primers. This method was used to sequence the human genome for the first time.

NGS is a faster and cheaper method than Sanger sequencing. With NGS, the DNA template is broken into millions of fragments that are then ligated to short nucleotide adapters. These adapters include bar codes for easy identification, as well as primers to allow capture of specific gene regions. Once captured, the DNA fragments are amplified, sequenced using labeled nucleotides, and compared with a reference sequence. This is a high-throughput method that is not as accurate as Sanger sequencing. Therefore, all variants are confirmed using Sanger sequencing before reporting. $^{1,2}$

Fatty acid oxidation defects are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders with a wide range of clinical presentations and are clinically triggered by fasting because of impaired ability to use stored fat. They should be suspected in neonates with abnormally low ketones in the presence of hypoglycemia. Newborns with fatty acid disorder can also present with encephalopathy, mild metabolic acidosis with increased lactate levels, hepatocellular dysfunction, and elevated ammonia levels. The diagnosis is confirmed by acylcarnitine profile abnormalities.

# 32. C. Cranial nerve dysfunction

CHARGE syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with a prevalence of 1 per 10,000 to 1 per 15,000 and is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies. The CHARGE acronym stands for Coloboma, Heart defects, choanal Atresia, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, and Ear anomalies or deafness. A mutation in chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) is found in 60% to 65% of affected patients.

A clinical diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome can be made if 4 major criteria or 3 major plus 3 minor criteria are met.2-4

Major criteria (the 4 Cs) are the following:

- Colobomas (80%-90% of cases); retinal colobomas are more common than iris colobomas
- Choanal atresia or stenosis (50%-60% of cases)
- Cranial nerve dysfunction (75%-95% of cases)
- Characteristic ear anomalies (90% of cases)

Minor criteria include the following:

- Cardiovascular malformations (75%-85% of cases), most commonly conotruncal anomalies and aortic arch defects
- Genital hypoplasia (50%-60% of cases)
- Growth deficiency (70%-80% of cases) and developmental delay (100% of cases)
- Orofacial cleft (15%-20% of cases)
- Tracheoesophageal fistula
- Distinctive facial features (70%-80% of cases)

## 35. D. In a female with OTC deficiency, increased expression of the X chromosome with the mutation in the OTC gene, particularly in the liver and kidney, will lead to more severe disease expression.

Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is an X-linked disorder occurring in 1 in 80,000 live births. Mutations in the ornithine transcarbamoyl-transferase gene are causative. OCT deficiency symptoms are due to a failure to convert ornithine to citrulline in the urea cycle, leading to hyperammonemia.

Affected boys (and rarely girls) typically present at age 2 to 3 days with severe hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratory alkalosis. Late presentations, or hyperammonemia crisis, can also occur. Girls have a more variable clinical picture than boys do because of the random degree of X inactivation in tissues, leading to variable OTC levels.¹

## 36. A. In organic acidopathies such as methylmalonic acidemia, the acidosis will likely be out of proportion to the lacticemia.

An elevated lactate level is a common occurrence in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and is in 1 of 4 distinct diagnostic categories¹:

1. Artefactual elevation. Sample collection technique and processing should always be evaluated when assessing a lactate level. Spurious lactate elevations are generally mild (&lt; 4 mmol/L) and should be suspected in a neonate who appears well.

2. Secondary to hypoxia. This is the most common cause of elevated lactate levels in the NICU. A history of hypoxia or hypotension is suggestive. In most of these cases, lactate levels are less than 5 mmol/L.

3. Secondary lactic acidosis; secondary to an inborn error of metabolism. Most organic acidopathies, as well as long-chain fatty acid defects, are associated with elevated lactate levels, most commonly in the range of 5 to 10 mmol/L. An organic acidopathy, such as methylmalonic acidemia, should be suspected when acidosis is out of proportion to the lacticemia. In addition, ketoacidosis, hyperammonemia, and hypoglycemia are also present. Urine organic acid quantification is the diagnostic test of choice in these situations. Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders can manifest with higher lactate levels, as well as hypoglycemia, elevated creatine kinase levels, dilated cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmia. An acylcarnitine profile is diagnostic and should be performed while the neonate is ill to avoid false-negative results.

4. Primary lactic acidosis; secondary to pyruvate metabolism or electron transport chain (ETC) defects. In both of these cases, lactic acidosis is severe, with lactate levels of 10 to 20 mmol/L. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) deficiency is the most common disorder of pyruvate metabolism. Neonates with PDHC deficiency present with encephalopathy and severe lactic acidosis and have associated structural brain anomalies, as well as facial dysmorphic features similar to those seen in fetal alcohol syndrome. Neonates with an ETC defect are often growth restricted and may present with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lens anomalies, as well as structural anomalies involving the brain and the gastrointestinal and skeletal systems.

## 38. E. Trisomy 21

Trisomy 21 is the most common trisomy, occurring in 45 per 10,000 conceptions. The spontaneous abortion rate is 78%, resulting in a trisomy 21 incidence of 1 in 600 to 1 in 800 births.

Trisomy 18 is much less common, occurring in 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 8,000 live births. Trisomy 18 occurs in 20 of 10,000 conceptions, with a spontaneous abortion rate of 95%. Trisomy 13 is the least common trisomy and occurs in 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 20,000 live births. The incidence of conception affected by trisomy 13 is 16 per 10,000, with a spontaneous abortion rate of 94%. Trisomy 16 occurs in 112 of 10,000 conceptions but is lethal in utero in 100% of cases.¹

## 39. D. Prader-Willi syndrome

Uniparental disomy (UPD) occurs when both chromosomes in a pair are inherited from the same parent, either the mother (maternal UPD) or the father (paternal UPD), resulting in alteration in the expression of essential imprinted genes.¹

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are caused by genetic abnormalities affecting chromosomal region 15q11-13, which contains several imprinted genes. PWS is caused by a de novo deletion of the paternal copy (70% of cases), by maternal UPD (25%-30% of cases), or by an imprinting defect. In contrast, AS is caused by a de novo deletion of the maternal copy (70% of cases), by paternal UPD (1%-2% of cases), by an imprinting disorder, or by a UBE3A mutation.²

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) are genetically heterogeneous syndromes, with most cases being caused by epigenetic and genetic abnormalities affecting chromosomal region 11p15.5.³ BWS has multiple epigenetic and genetic causes, including

hypomethylation at imprinting control region (ICR) 2 (50%–60% of cases), hypermethylation at ICR1 (5%–10% of cases), paternal UPD (20%–27% of cases), and paternal microduplications and microdeletions. In approximately 60% of patients with SRS, an underlying molecular cause is identified, including loss of methylation of chromosomal region 11p15.5 (30%–60% of cases) and maternal UPD for chromosomal region 7 (5%–10% of cases).²

Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is caused by an inactivating germ line mutation of imprinted gene GNAS1 transmitted by the mother. Paternal transmission of GNAS1 mutation leads to pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A.

## 40. C. Cleidocranial dysplasia

The presence of a large fontanelle and wide sutures at the physical examination of a neonate with skeletal dysplasia is most suggestive of cleidocranial dysplasia.

Cleidocranial dysplasia is a rare autosomal dominant disorder occurring in 0.5 per 100,000 live births. The presence of clavicle hypoplasia with drooping shoulders, large fontanelle and wide sutures, and midface hypoplasia should raise suspicion in the neonatal period.¹

## 41. B. Glutaric acidemia type I

Glutaric acidemia type I is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by glutaryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. Most patients present in infancy with acute encephalopathy, typically triggered by an infection. The resultant striatal injury leads to abnormal posturing, including severe dystonia, opisthotonos, and athetosis. Macrocephaly is common in glutaric acidemia type I and may be present at birth.¹

## 42. D. Myotonic dystrophy

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder that can manifest in the newborn period with hypotonia, respiratory distress, poor feeding, talipes equinovarus, and eyelid ptosis. It is caused by expansion of trinucleotide cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeats in the noncoding region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene on chromosome 19. The diagnosis is confirmed by a CTG repeat length greater than 50, although most affected neonates have more than 200 repeats. Of note, a CTG repeat length between 37 and 50 is considered a premutation state.¹

45. D. This test may be useful for detecting potential cases of disorders in both aneuploidy and euploidy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are DNA polymorphisms that constitute approximately 1.6% of the human genome. SNP-based approaches provide a platform for genomewide sequence variation analysis, including the detection of consanguinity and most uniparental disomy. The technique developed by Zimmerman et al¹ measured cell-free fetal DNA by using the targeted sequencing of 11,000 SNPs to determine euploidy or aneuploidy in the fetus. Unlike massively parallel shotgun sequencing, SNP-based techniques can also detect triploidy.¹

SNP-based approaches have been tested for noninvasive prenatal testing and can detect aneuploidy with a sensitivity of 100% for trisomy 21 and 99.9% for trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and monosomy X.²,³

46. B. In addition to hyperammonemia, neonates will have encephalopathy and respiratory alkalosis. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder occurring in 1 in 80,000 live births and is caused by a mutation in the ornithine transcarbamoyl-transferase gene. This results in hyperammonemia due to failure to convert ornithine to citrulline in the urea cycle. Patients affected by OTC present with the classic triad of hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratory alkalosis.

Affected boys, and in rare cases girls, typically present at age 2 to 3 days. Late presentations can also occur. Girls have a more variable clinical picture than do boys because of the random degree of X inactivation in tissues leading to variable OTC levels.¹

47. D. In neonates with primary lactic acidosis with normal pyruvate levels, whole exome sequencing is the test of choice, although sequencing for a panel of known mitochondrial genes is another option. Mitochondrial diseases are a cause of primary lactic acidosis in the neonate, and there are more than 100 disorders described to date. Most neonates with mitochondrial disease have a mutation in nuclear genes.

Increased lactate, typically greater than 10 mmol/L, is often the first sign of a mitochondrial disorder in the neonatal population. In contrast to primary lactic acidosis secondary to pyruvate metabolism disorders, pyruvate is not elevated in mitochondrial diseases.

Diagnostic testing should involve a full metabolic evaluation, including plasma amino acid profile and acylcarnitine profile, as well as whole exome sequencing. Targeted mitochondrial gene panels are also available.¹

Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) has a higher sensitivity and specificity than does sequential testing for trisomy identification. Studies indicate that the positive predictive value of NIPS for trisomy 21 is 94% in women at high risk and 50% to 81% in women at low risk, which is much higher than that of sequential screening (3.4%). In addition, NIPS has a negative predictive value of close to 100%. Although sensitive and specific for the detection of trisomies, NIPS has a low positive predictive value for the detection of copy number variations (3.8%–18%).

## 50. B. Loss of methylation of imprinting control region 2 on the maternal chromosome

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a genetic syndrome caused by alterations in genomic imprinting pathways on chromosome 11p15.5. This chromosomal region contains 2 imprinting centers (ICs), IC1 and IC2, that are methylated in a parent-of-origin manner. BWS is caused by heterogeneous molecular defects, including loss of methylation of IC2 on the maternal chromosome (50%–60% of cases), paternal uniparental disomy (20%–27% of cases), gain of methylation of maternal chromosome at IC1 (5%–10% of cases), and 11p15 paternal microduplications and microdeletions. These complex molecular defects all result in an imbalance in the expression of growth inhibitor and growth promotor genes.¹²

Neonates with BWS can present with hypoglycemia, abdominal wall defects, hemihyperplasia, macroglossia, and visceromegaly.

## 52. C. Is mostly placental rather than fetal in origin

The discovery that all pregnant women have cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was made in 1997.¹ Current data indicate that 10% to 20% of the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in the maternal plasma is of fetal origin. This fetal fraction (cffDNA) originates from the placenta and can be identified in the maternal circulation of 80% of pregnant women by 28 days of gestation (before the establishment of the fetoplacental circulation). cffDNA is stabilized in the maternal circulation by binding to apoptotic bodies. It is shorter than is maternal cfDNA (~150 base pairs compared with 300 base pairs) and has a half-life of 16 minutes in the maternal circulation. The cffDNA rapidly clears from the maternal circulation after delivery.²⁻⁵

# 55. C. Glutathione

Multiple antioxidant systems, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic, have evolved to counteract oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important nonenzymatic intracellular antioxidant. GSH molecules form a disulfide bond to form oxidized GSH (GSSG) and in the process serve as electron donors, leading to reduction of disulfide bonds. Glutathione reductase then reduces GSSG back to GSH by using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor. Other nonenzymatic antioxidants include transferrin and ceruloplasmin, which can bind transition metals, as well as free radical quenchers, such as uric acid and bilirubin.

Enzymatic pathways of defense against free radical injury include the superoxide dismutase family of antioxidant enzymes, catalases, GSH peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.¹ Newborns, particularly those born preterm, are at increased risk of oxidative stress because of an immature antioxidant system.¹,²

# 56. E. 69,XXX

Triploidy is rare, occurring in 1 in 100,000 live-born neonates. G-banded karyotype studies demonstrate 69 chromosomes: XXX, XXY, or XYY. Triploidy is associated with intrauterine growth restriction, hypotonia, hydrops, and poly- or oligohydramnios, as well as multiple congenital anomalies as in the case described in the vignette. Triploidy is a lethal condition.¹

Single sex chromosome aneuploidies (47,XXX, 47,XXY, and 47,XYY) are typically associated with a mild phenotype. In contrast, sex chromosome polysomies (XXXX, XXXXX, XXYY, XXXY, and so forth) have a more severe phenotype that includes growth delays, microcephaly, dysmorphic features, renal and cardiac abnormalities, and intellectual disabilities that increase in severity with each additional sex chromosome.²

# 57. C. Association

VACTERL is an example of an association. An association describes a group of anomalies occurring more frequently together than would be expected by chance alone but with no identified unifying cause. The VACTERL association occurs in 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 40,000 live-born neonates and is defined as follows¹:

- Vertebral anomalies (60%–80% of cases), often associated with rib anomalies
- Anorectal malformations, including anal atresia and imperforate anus (55%–90% of cases)
- Cardiac defects (40%–80% of cases)
- Tracheoesophageal fistula (50%–80% of cases)
- Renal anomalies (50%–80% of cases)

# 58. C. A notable barrier of applying genomic technologies to newborn screening is the burden of variant interpretation because there will inevitably be variants of unknown significance found in newborns who are unaffected or mildly affected.

The use of whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing for newborn screening remains controversial primarily because of variant interpretation challenges. In addition, the issue of identification of carrier state has not been resolved in terms of psychological effect and follow-up requirements. Furthermore, the identification of pathogenic variants causing adult-onset disease has also raised additional concerns about genetic discrimination, data storage, and need for counseling and follow-up guidelines. Other barriers to using these genomic methods for newborn screening include cost and time to result.¹⁻⁴

# 60. C. Maternal weight may affect the accuracy of cffDNA testing because the amount of cffDNA in relation to the total would be relatively decreased.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) based on the analysis of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has revolutionized prenatal testing in recent years. NIPT has several advantages over traditional screening approaches including the following:

- High sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of chromosomal aneuploidies
- Reduction in invasive procedures
- Decreased risk of pregnancy loss associated with invasive testing¹,²

However, there are important limitations to NIPT. First, NIPT is a screening test and therefore false-negative and false-positive results are expected to occur. Second, most studies have reported results in singleton pregnancies, and the utility in multiple pregnancies remains unclear at this time. Third, maternal obesity may affect the accuracy of cffDNA testing because of the decrease in cffDNA relative to total cell-free DNA in the maternal serum.³⁻⁶

61. C. Severity of symptoms, including more significant intellectual disability (mental retardation) and hypogonadism, is seen with a higher number of additional X chromosomes (such as 48,XXXY).

Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) occurs in 1 in 600 live male births. Affected patients typically present with hypogonadism with azoospermia or oligospermia and gynecomastia in late puberty. They can have normal intelligence, although learning or psychosocial problems are commonly reported. The severity of the syndrome is proportional to the number of additional X chromosomes. In all cases, only 1 of the X chromosomes is functional because of the process of X inactivation. $^{1}$

62. C. Unless a specific secondary defect is known, the glucose infusion rate is used to target euglycemia.

Primary causes of lactic acidosis include pyruvate metabolism disorders and disorders of the electron transport chain. Lactate levels are characteristically very elevated (&gt; 10 mmol/L) in primary lactic acidosis disorders.

For neonates suspected of having primary lactic acidosis, the goals of treatment include the following:

- Correction of the metabolic acidosis by using bicarbonate. Tromethamine should not be used when an inborn error of metabolism is suspected because of associated hyperammonemia. Acetate and citrate, although safe, have limited efficacy because of their metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
- Halting of catabolism by using the glucose infusion rate to maintain euglycemia until a specific diagnosis is known. In patients who are stable, enteral nutrition may be less likely to lead to increased lactate levels.
- Treatment of additional manifestations, including treatment of hyperammonemia, and consideration of cardiac transplant in the presence of cardiomyopathy.
- Initiation of thiamine and biotin that are cofactors for common enzymatic defects.

63. D. This patient has at least 1 major anomaly.

Congenital anomalies can be classified as major and minor on the basis of their medical and/or cosmetic effect. Major anomalies have a significant effect and are never considered part of normal variation. These include congenital heart disease, cleft lip and palate, ectrodactyly, holoprosencephaly, and so on. In contrast, minor anomalies do not have a medical effect but are uncommon in the general population (&lt; 4% of individuals). These include findings such as single palmar crease, ear tags and pits, lip pits, for example. Minor anomalies occur in 20%, 0.8%, and 0.5% of healthy newborns for 1, 2, and 3 minor anomalies, respectively. Although minor anomalies do not have a significant medical effect in isolation, the occurrence of 2 minor anomalies is associated with a 10% risk of major malformation. This risk increases to 20% if 3 anomalies are present.

Newborns with more than 1 anomaly are classified as follows $^{1,2}$:

- Association—describes anomalies occurring together more than would be expected by chance but with no underlying unifying cause (eg, VACTERL association)
- Deformation—anomalies secondary to external forces during development
- Disruption—growth arrest of a normally developing structure by an external force (eg, amniotic bands)
- Sequence—related anomalies secondary to a single major anomaly (eg, Pierre Robin sequence)
- Syndrome—anomalies occurring in a predictable manner and with a single cause (eg, trisomy 21)

## 69. B. Identification of multinucleated cells of placental origin in maternal blood.

The discovery of multinucleated cells of placental origin was first described in the maternal circulation and lung tissue at maternal autopsy in 1893.¹ This was followed, much later, by the identification of fetal red blood cells in the maternal circulation in the 1950s. The existence of cell-free DNA in the circulation was first discovered in patients with cancer in the 1970s. In pregnant patients, the first discovery was the presence of the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene in the maternal circulation. Fetal DNA in maternal blood was first isolated in 1989. However, it was not until 1997 that investigators demonstrated that the cell-free fetal DNA portion was relatively large and could be distinguished from the maternal cell-free DNA, thereby ushering in the era of noninvasive prenatal testing.²

## 70. A. Biotinidase deficiency

Many routine neonatal intensive care unit interventions can interfere with newborn screening tests, so the likelihood of both false-positive and false-negative results is increased¹:

- Metabolic testing may be falsely negative in newborns who are not feeding enterally.
- Administration of corticosteroids may lead to false-negative results in newborns with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
- The administration of parenteral nutrition and/or aminoglycosides can lead to false-positive results for biotinidase deficiency.
- Prematurity may lead to false-positive screening results for both congenital adrenal hyperplasia and congenital hypothyroidism.

Epigenetic gene regulation is the result of complex interactions among the DNA, the transcription machinery, and cofactors. Epigenetic mechanisms are critical to gene regulation and switch genes on or off on the basis of developmental stage, cell-specific needs, and environmental factors. The CpG dinucleotide is the only dinucleotide that can be modified epigenetically. The methylation of CpG dinucleotides present in a promoter region of the genome leads to gene silencing. In contrast, CpG dinucleotides present elsewhere in the genome are typically methylated at baseline and regulate promoter function, as well as transcription.¹,²

Although the degree of respiratory distress is variable, most affected patients present in the neonatal period with respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. The physical examination may reveal the following findings:

- Long, narrow thorax
- Short hands or feet with short middle and distal phalanges
- Postaxial polydactyly
- Multiple gingival frenula
- Hydrocephalus

Radiographic studies reveal metaphyseal irregularities and cone-shaped epiphyses. Patients with Jeune syndrome may also develop progressive renal disease, as well as pancreatic and hepatic fibrosis. Hirschsprung disease has also been described.¹⁻³

## 73. A. Fetal movement restriction

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) encompasses a spectrum of hip abnormalities ranging from minor self-correcting abnormalities to congenital hip dislocation. The incidence of DDH ranges from 1% to 7% of newborns, varies by ethnicity, and affects girls 4 to 8 times more frequently than boys. It is unilateral in 63% of cases and more often occurs on the left side.

Risk factors for DDH include any cause of intrauterine fetal movement restriction and include the following:

- Female sex (75.5% of cases)
- First pregnancy
- Oligohydramnios
- Breech presentation (particularly extended breech)

However, most patients with DDH (75%) do not have a risk factor, emphasizing the need for careful hip examination at birth.¹,²

## 74. A. Superoxide anion

Oxygen free radicals are highly chemically reactive and can cause functional and structural damage to cell components. Superoxide anion is the most abundant free radical. It is the precursor to most reactive oxygen species and mediates oxidative chain reactions. Superoxide dismutase leads to the dismutation of superoxide anion and produces hydrogen peroxide, which in turn is fully reduced to water by glutathione reductase or is partially reduced to hydroxyl radical. Hydroxyl radical is the strongest oxidant and leads to structural and functional cell damage. Superoxide anion can also react with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite, a highly reactive compound.¹⁻³

HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY

1. C. In contrast to ABO incompatibility, many cases of NAIT occur during first pregnancies.

Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) results from maternal production of antibodies directed against paternally derived antigens on the fetal platelets, most commonly the human platelet antigen (HPA)-1a. $^{1,2}$ In contrast to ABO or Rh incompatibility, NAIT occurs during a first pregnancy in approximately 50% of cases. An increase in NAIT severity is typically seen in the subsequent pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis of the index newborn. Treatment for newborns with severe NAIT includes random donor platelets; intravenous immunoglobulin; and, in severe cases, compatible HPA-1a-negative platelets, as well as washed maternal platelets. $^{2}$

2. A. β-glucuronidase

Enterohepatic bilirubin circulation is increased in the newborn period because of both high β-glucuronidase activity and immature intestinal bacterial flora. β-Glucuronidase deconjugates bilirubin, allowing for its reabsorption in the intestine. $^{1}$

Biliverdin reductase is necessary for the catabolism of biliverdin to unconjugated bilirubin in the reticuloendothelial system of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. $^{1}$

Uridine diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase converts the unconjugated bilirubin to a water-soluble conjugated compound inside the hepatocyte.

4. D. Prothrombin

The levels and function of coagulation proteins are developmentally regulated and are low in the term neonate, maturing over weeks to years to adult levels. $^{1}$ Fibrinogen, factor V, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor are the only coagulation proteins that are within the adult range at birth. $^{2}$ Some factors, such as vitamin K-dependent factors, as well as factors XI and XII, prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen, are low at birth (50% of adult levels) but mature rapidly postnatally, approaching adult levels by age 6 months. In contrast, prothrombin levels remain low throughout childhood. It is important to take into account these differences when interpreting screening coagulation tests in term and preterm neonates.

## 6. D. Hyperkalemia

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions remain an important intervention in the care of neonates who are ill. In this population, RBC products are modified to account for the relative immune deficiency of the neonate. In most countries, leukoreduced and irradiated RBCs are used.¹ Leukoreduction reduces white blood cell counts by 99.9%,² whereas irradiation inactivates donor lymphocytes, thereby decreasing the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. Using RBCs shortly after the irradiation procedure is recommended because of the risk of hyperkalemia. The process of irradiation leads to potassium leakage from the RBCs and decreases the shelf life of the product.³

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway of red blood cell (RBC) metabolism. It oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconic acid and catalyzes NADP to its reduced form, NADPH, is critical for the maintenance of reduced forms of glutathione and thereby cellular defense against oxidative stress. The pentose phosphate pathway is the only source of NADPH for RBCs such that patients with G6PD deficiency have RBCs that are susceptible to hemolysis when exposed to oxidative stress.¹

Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F [α₂γ₂]) is 34% of the total hemoglobin between 5 and 6 weeks of gestation, increasing to 50% by 16 weeks and 90% by 20 weeks.¹ Hemoglobin F differs from hemoglobin A (α₂β₂) in multiple ways. It has a much greater affinity for oxygen than does hemoglobin A because of decreased interaction with 2,3-disphosphoglycerate. Hemoglobin F can be oxidized to methemoglobin more readily than can hemoglobin A. Finally, it is resistant to acid elution, a property used to distinguish fetal cells from maternal cells in the Kleihauer-Betke test.²

11. D. In the PINT study, Kirpalani et al found that neonates in the restrictive group were more likely to avoid transfusion than were those in the liberal group, although most neonates in both groups received a transfusion.

Red blood cell transfusions are frequently needed when caring for extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW) neonates; however, consensus regarding optimal thresholds for transfusion is lacking. Several trials have investigated liberal versus restrictive transfusion thresholds in this population.

The Premature Infants in Need of Transfusion (PINT) study investigated the effect of restrictive versus liberal transfusion thresholds on mortality and short-term morbidity in 451 ELBW neonates.1 In this study, 451 neonates were randomly assigned to a low or a high transfusion threshold. Although most neonates in both groups received blood transfusions, 89% of neonates in the restrictive group received transfusions versus 95% in the liberal group (P = .037). There were no significant differences in mortality and short-term neonatal intensive care unit morbidities, including retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or brain injury.1 However, at follow-up at age 18 to 21 months, children in the liberal group had improved mental developmental index at post hoc analysis.2

The Iowa trial investigated liberal versus restrictive transfusion guidelines in 100 preterm neonates with birth weights between 500 and 1,300 g.3 In this trial, there was no difference between groups in blood transfusion exposure, and neonates in the restrictive group were more likely to experience apnea, intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia.

Thrombopoiesis, or platelet production, is different in neonates and adults. Neonates, particularly those who are small for gestational age, have lower thrombopoeitin (Tpo) levels compared with levels observed in children or adults. In addition, they have a higher number of circulating megakaryocyte progenitors. These megakaryocyte progenitors are structurally and functionally different from those in adults, with lower ploidy and size, as well as higher proliferative ability and sensitivity to Tpo.1,2 Despite all of these differences in thrombopoiesis, neonates achieve normal platelet counts because of the increased proliferative potential of the megakaryocyte progenitors.

13. D. This type of tumor is derived from mesenchymal cells and composed of masses of blood vessels that are irregular in arrangement and size.

Hemangiomas occur in 3% of neonates and are the most common tumors in this population. Hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that can occur anywhere in cutaneous, subcutaneous, and visceral locations, including the liver. Hepatic hemangiomas are derived from mesenchymal cells and composed of masses of blood vessels that are irregular in arrangement and size. They are more common in females and are cutaneous hemangiomas in approximately 50% of cases.1 Hepatic hemangiomas can also occur as part of a syndrome, including Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber or Osler-Rendu-Weber syndromes.

Neonates with hepatic hemangiomas can be asymptomatic or can present with abdominal distension and respiratory compromise or with cardiac failure, consumptive coagulopathy, or thrombocytopenia (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome). Hypothyroidism has also been described in association with hepatic hemangiomas and is secondary to high levels of type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase in the hemangioma.

Similar to hemangiomas located in other areas, hepatic hemangiomas undergo rapid proliferation followed by a slower resolution phase over years. Expectant conservative management is appropriate in most cases. $^{1,2}$

## 14. C. Leukocyte reduction by means of filtration

The use of both leukocyte-reduced red blood cells (RBCs) and RBCs from cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative donors decreases the risk of CMV infection by 92% to 93%. $^{1,2}$ γ irradiation of the RBCs is used to decrease the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. Single-donor programs, in which RBCs are stored for up to 42 days, decrease donor exposures in newborns.

## 15. E. Up to 40% of the population of China and Southeast Asia are reportedly α-thalassemia carriers.

α-Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that is especially frequent in Asia, Mediterranean countries, and Africa. The carrier rate is reported to be as high as 40% in China and Southeast Asia. $^{1}$ Because α-globin gene expression begins in utero, α-thalassemias manifest earlier (in utero or during the neonatal period) than do β-thalassemias. $^{1,2}$

α-Thalassemia is caused by mutations in 1 or more of the 4 α-globin genes, resulting in decreased α-globin production (α+) or complete absence of α-globin (α−). Severity depends on the number of affected genes:

## 16. D. Laboratory phlebotomy losses are typically 15% to 30% of a neonate’s total blood volume in the first 6 weeks after birth.

Iatrogenic blood loss via phlebotomy losses is an important contributing factor in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion needs in extremely low-birth-weight neonates. Studies indicate that drawing of blood can amount to 15% to 30%¹ of a neonate’s total blood volume in the first 6 weeks alone, directly correlating with RBC transfusion volumes.²

In preterm neonates, delayed cord clamping decreases the need for transfusions in addition to lowering the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis.³ In a meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials, umbilical cord milking did not decrease the need for RBC transfusions.⁴

The overall incidence in the United States is 3.4%, with male blacks having the highest incidence at 12.2%.¹² Neonates with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency have an increased risk of neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy and exchange transfusion.³ Screening neonates at risk in the neonatal period is important to improve outcomes. However, screening assays measure enzyme activity and may be falsely negative in the presence of significant hemolysis reflecting the presence of reticulocytes with normal enzyme activity levels.

## 20. A. Delay in meconium elimination

Breastfeeding jaundice is secondary to insufficient intake of breast milk and is suspected in newborns with:

- Weight loss greater than 5% to 7%
- Delayed meconium elimination
- Persistence of meconium stools on day 3 or 4 after birth
- Fewer than 3 stools per day

Breastfeeding jaundice is different from breast milk jaundice, which may occur in 2% to 4% of neonates who are breastfed. Breast milk jaundice occurs later, after the first postnatal week, and persists for 2 to 3 weeks and, in some cases, for up to 3 months.

## 21. E. Prothrombin

Congenital deficiencies in factor (F) III (tissue factor [TF]) have not been described, presumably because they are lethal. TF is released after an injury to the vascular endothelium and is a potent initiator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway by forming a complex with FVII and directly or indirectly activating FX. Activated FX subsequently converts prothrombin (FII) to thrombin (FIIa) and initiates the common pathway of the coagulation cascade leading to fibrin formation.¹

## 22. A. A newer form of Epo, darbepoetin alfa, has a half-life that is 13- to 14-fold longer than that of rhEpo.

In preterm neonates, erythropoietin (Epo) is produced mainly in the liver, which is less sensitive to anemia than is the kidney, resulting in insufficient Epo production in this population. The use of recombinant human Epo (rhEpo) has been investigated as a means of reducing red blood cell transfusions in preterm neonates. Data suggest decreased transfusion needs in preterm neonates weighing less than 750 g at birth who received rhEpo for 2 weeks.¹ The administration of darbepoetin alfa, an analogue of rhEpo with a 13- to 14-fold longer half-life, resulted similarly in fewer transfusions than did rhEpo.² The risks and benefits of rhEpo continue to be investigated, with some studies indicating an increased risk of retinopathy of prematurity with higher cumulative doses of rhEpo³,⁴ and others finding neuroprotective effects.⁵,⁶

## 23. C. The patient can be monitored clinically, and a platelet count can be repeated the next morning.

Thrombocytopenia is a common problem, affecting 25% to 30% of all neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Thrombocytopenia can be classified as mild (100,000–150,100/mcL), moderate (50,000–100,000/mcL), or severe (&lt; 50,000/mcL). The risk of bleeding increases with the severity of the thrombocytopenia:

- Minimal risk for platelet count 20,000 to 100,000/mcL
- Moderate risk for platelet count less than 20,000/mcL
- Severe risk for platelet count less than 5,000/mcL

Healthy neonates with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia can be monitored closely without additional investigation or intervention unless the thrombocytopenia persists for more than 5 to 7 days. A sepsis evaluation is recommended in neonates who are ill and have mild to moderate thrombocytopenia with no evidence of placental insufficiency.¹

## 24. C. Levels of urinary catecholamine metabolites, such as vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid, are elevated in more than 90% of neonates with neuroblastoma and are detectable in random urine samples.

Neuroblastoma, the most common neonatal malignancy, originates in the adrenal medulla and anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system, with the liver and skin being the most common metastatic locations. Mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma gene are noted in 1% to 2% of cases.

Neonates with neuroblastoma may be asymptomatic or can present with an abdominal mass, hepatomegaly, and subcutaneous skin nodules (blueberry muffin baby).

---

<!-- Page 447 -->

Diagnostic investigations include imaging (ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging), meta-iodobenzylguanidine scanning, and elevated urinary vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid (elevated in 90% of cases). The diagnosis is confirmed by means of biopsy of the primary or metastatic tumor.

Neonates with a neuroblastoma, including those with liver, skin, and bone metastasis, have a favorable prognosis compared with that of neonates who present with a neuroblastoma later in life, with spontaneous regression observed in many cases. Because of these unique characteristics, neuroblastomas in the neonatal population have their own stage (4S).1,2

25. A. Bacterial or viral sepsis

In the evaluation of a neonate with thrombocytopenia, the following characteristics are important considerations in establishing a differential diagnosis:

• Ill appearance versus well appearance

• Timing of manifestation of the thrombocytopenia (early onset < 72 hours versus late onset ≥ 72 hours after birth)1

For neonates who have late-onset thrombocytopenia and appear ill, prompt evaluation for bacterial, fungal, and viral sepsis is recommended. Other causes include necrotizing enterocolitis and inborn errors of metabolism, such as propionic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, and Gaucher disease.

For neonates who appear well and have late-onset thrombocytopenia, drug-induced thrombocytopenia (heparin, antibiotics), thromboses, and Fanconi anemia should be considered in the differential diagnosis.2

Eighty percent of fetal iron stores are accrued in the third trimester, and these accretion rates (1.6--2.0 mg/kg/d) are not affected by mild maternal anemia.1 Hepcidin is a key regulator of maternal--fetal iron metabolism. Maternal hepcidin exerts a negative effect on iron absorption and placental transfer, whereas fetal hepcidin can downregulate placental iron delivery if needs are met or in case of inflammation. With the 6-fold increase in iron absorption needs during pregnancy, a corresponding decrease in maternal hepcidin is noted with advancing pregnancy.2,3

Severe placental insufficiency with associated intrauterine growth restriction results in a decrease in placental iron transfer.4

Although maternal serum ferritin levels are positively linked to fetal iron stores, the treatment of mild iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women has not conclusively been shown to improve maternal or fetal iron status. Treatment does, however, lead to fetal benefits, such as decreased risk of low birth weight or preterm delivery.1

Decreased fetal iron stores have been linked to adverse neurocognitive outcomes later in life. Low fetal iron stores can occur with placental insufficiency, diabetes, severe psychological stressors, severe maternal obesity, and anemia of chronic illness with increased hepcidin levels resulting in decreased placental iron transfer.2,3 In addition, fetal conditions linked to low iron stores include fetal overgrowth, male sex, preterm birth, and multiple gestation.4

# 28. D. Photosensitization-induced cytotoxicity

Tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP), a competitive inhibitor of heme oxygenase, is emerging as a pharmacological option for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. One of the side effects of SnMP is photosensitization, so use of SnMP in conjunction with phototherapy is not recommended. $^{1}$ Animal studies indicate that in addition to SnMP inhibiting heme oxygenase, SnMP inhibits hemoprotein nitric oxide synthase $^{2}$ and may increase levels of inducible heme oxygenase. $^{3}$ These effects remain poorly understood. Furthermore, lack of data on the long-term effect of SnMP use has limited its use in the clinical setting in the United States.

Hemoglobin (Hb) Constant Spring is an abnormal Hb caused by a mutation at position 142 in which glutamine (Gln) replaces a termination codon, thereby leading to an abnormally long and unstable Hb chain (α⁰, α142, Term → Gln). It is the most common nondeletional mutation associated with α-thalassemia and is more prevalent in Southeast Asia. Hb Constant Spring, when inherited with a cis-mutation (⁻/α⁰α), tends to be more severe than in the nondeletion form of HbH (⁻/α⁻). Patients with HbH-Constant Spring require more frequent and earlier transfusions.¹²

In contrast, a neonate who is ill but with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count between 100,000 and 150,000/mcL) and no history of placental insufficiency would warrant an evaluation for sepsis and initiation of antibiotic therapy.¹²

## 36. A. α-Fetoprotein is elevated in 90% of patients with hepatoblastoma, and low levels of α-fetoprotein are a marker for poor prognosis.

Although hepatoblastomas rarely occur in neonates, they are the most common primary liver malignancy in this population. In this age group, hepatoblastoma can occur in association with genetic syndromes, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and trisomy 18.¹²

Hepatoblastomas typically manifest as hyperechoic, noncystic liver masses, most commonly of the right lobe of the liver (70% of cases). α-Fetoprotein levels are very elevated (in the range of several thousands) in 90% of neonates with hepatoblastoma. Metastasis can occur, most commonly in the lungs. Complete surgical resection followed by chemotherapy is the treatment of choice.³

## 39. A. Brain

Heme oxygenase (HO) is involved in the initial and rate-limiting step in the degradation of heme and production of bilirubin. Two isoforms have been described¹²:

- HO-1, present primarily in the spleen, and inducible by its substrate heme
- HO-2, predominantly expressed in the brain and developmentally regulated

## 40. E. Spectrophotometric assay based on the rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate formation

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a risk factor for severe hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.¹ The diagnosis is confirmed using a spectrophotometric quantitative enzyme assay based on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) formation. This quantitative method measures enzyme activity directly, and an enzyme activity level less than 30% of normal is confirmatory.²

Screening tests are also available, including the following:

- The fluorescent spot test, a semiquantitative method, is the recommended screening test. This test is not sensitive for patients with enzyme activity levels between 20% and 60%. During hemolysis, false-negative results may occur because of the increased level of G6PD in reticulocytes and younger erythrocytes.
- Other methods (methylene blue reduction, cresyl blue dye decolorization, cytochemical staining) to detect NADPH are not routinely used.

The identification of the specific mutations by means of DNA polymerase chain reaction is limited because of the large genetic heterogeneity and the limited number of known mutations.

## 41. B. VII

Tissue factor (TF) is released after vascular endothelial cell damage and forms a complex with factor (F)VII, thereby initiating the extrinsic coagulation pathway. The complex of TF and activated FVII then directly or indirectly promotes conversion of FX to activated FX, which in turns converts prothrombin (FII) to thrombin (FIIa) and initiates the common pathway of the coagulation cascade leading to fibrin formation.[1,2]

## 42. A. Delayed umbilical cord clamping

Delayed cord clamping results in a 10% to 15% increase in red blood cell volume, thereby increasing the iron endowment of the neonate.[1] In contrast, maternal psychological stress, diabetes, severe maternal obesity, and placental dysfunction all result in compromised placental iron transfer during pregnancy and subsequent decreased iron endowment for the neonate.[2-4]

## 43. C. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia

Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) should be considered in neonates who appear well but have early-onset (&lt; 72 hours after birth) moderate to severe thrombocytopenia (50,000-100,000/mcL and &lt; 50,000/mcL, respectively).[1] It occurs when maternal antibodies against fetal platelet antigen inherited from the father cross the placenta and lead to fetal platelet destruction. Most cases of NAIT (95%) are caused by 3 human platelet antigens (HPAs): HPA-1a, HPA-5b, and HPA-15b. HPA-1a causes 75% of NAIT cases in white neonates. HPA-1a incompatibility occurs in 1 in 350 pregnancies and results in thrombocytopenia in 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 1,500 affected pregnancies.[2]

Neonatal autoimmune thrombocytopenia is caused by maternal autoantibodies, most commonly in mothers with immune thrombocytopenic purpura or systemic lupus erythematosus. It occurs in 1 to 2 in 1,000 pregnancies and can be distinguished from NAIT by the presence of a low maternal platelet count.[3]

Inherited thrombocytopenias, including Bernard-Soulier and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes, are rare disorders in which thrombocytopenia is the result of decreased production.[4]

44. E. The most common tumor of the kidney in the neonate is congenital mesoblastic nephroma, with cells predominantly composed of fibroblastic cells and confined to the renal capsule.

Most renal masses detected in the newborn period are secondary to malformations such as hydronephrosis and polycystic kidney disease.

Congenital mesoblastic nephroma, which occurs exclusively in the first 6 months after birth, is the most common neonatal renal tumor (75% of cases) and has the following characteristics¹,²:

- Mesenchymal tumor predominantly composed of fibroblastic cells
- Divided into 2 subtypes:
- Classical
- Cellular associated with translocation t(12;15) and increased risk of recurrence and metastases
- Confined to the renal capsule in most cases
- Nephrectomy alone is usually curative

Other renal tumors occurring in the neonatal period include the following:

- Wilms tumor (WT), or nephroblastoma, rarely manifests in neonates (0.2% of all cases) and is associated with a syndrome in 25% of cases (WT, aniridia, genitourinary tract abnormalities, intellectual disability [WAGR] syndrome; Denys-Drash syndrome; Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome; Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome). Mutations in WT1 11p13 and WT2 11p15 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of WT, but most patients do not have these mutations.³,⁴
- Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, a very aggressive tumor, often manifests in advanced stages and has a high mortality rate.
- Clear cell carcinoma of the kidney is a very rare tumor with a better outcome in neonates than in older children.

45. C. Increased metabolic clearance of Epo

After birth, erythropoietin (Epo) levels decrease rapidly to very low levels, resulting in a decrease in reticulocytes and nucleated red blood cell counts within 5 to 7 days. There is evidence that low Epo concentrations in neonates with anemia should be viewed as physiological because of the following factors¹:

- Increased sensitivity of erythroid progenitors to Epo
- Decreased tissue oxygenation set point for Epo production
- Increased metabolic clearance of Epo
- Paracrine hormone effect of Epo in the liver
- Increased erythropoietic capacity as indicated by higher reticulocyte counts¹

46. B. For carriers with α-globin gene mutations, Asian individuals tend to have cis-mutations, whereas trans-mutations (on opposite sides of chromosome 16) are more likely to be seen in blacks.

α-Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in 1 or more of the 4 α-globin genes located on chromosome 16 and resulting in decreased α-globin production (α+) or complete absence of α-globin (α−). The severity of the disorder depends on the number of affected genes¹,²:

- α-Thalassemia carrier = 1 gene affected (-α/αα)
- α-Thalassemia trait = 2 genes affected. Two forms of α-thalassemia trait occur. Mutations on the same side of chromosome 16 (cis-mutation; −/αα) are more common in Asians. Mutations on opposite sides of chromosome 16 (trans-mutation; −α/−α) are more common in blacks.
- Hemoglobin (Hb) H disease = 3 genes affected with 2 distinct forms: (1) HbH (−/−α) and (2) HbH Constant Spring (−αᴳᴮ/−α), in which 1 of the affected genes has a mutation at position 142 in which glutamine replaces a termination codon thereby leading to an abnormally long and unstable Hb chain. Individuals with HbH Constant Spring have more severe clinical features than do those with HbH.
- If all 4 genes are affected (−/−), no α-globin chain is produced, resulting in Hb Bart production and hydrops fetalis.

## 50. A. RBC transfusion has been associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, with 1 study showing an association of increased number of transfusions related to increased severity of pulmonary disease.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions can be lifesaving in neonates who are ill but have also been associated with an increased risk of several morbidities. Multiple studies have found an association between RBC transfusions and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD),¹⁻⁴ including 1 study linking increased number of transfusions to increased disease severity.³ A study in 2006 suggested that necrotizing enterocolitis might be associated with RBC transfusions.⁵ Transfusions may also be implicated in the development of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH),⁶ with 1 study indicating an association between transfusion and progression from low-grade to high-grade IVH.⁷ Finally, studies have found an independent association between RBC transfusions and development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).⁸,⁹

However, the Premature Infants in Need of Transfusion trial did not demonstrate a decrease in BPD, ROP, or brain injury with use of liberal versus restrictive transfusion strategies.¹⁰

Current guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics support providing oral iron supplementation at a dose of approximately 2 mg/kg daily to all preterm neonates, starting at 2 to 4 weeks after birth and continuing until 1 year of age.¹ Iron content in formula or human milk should be taken into consideration when calculating supplementation needs. In addition, preterm and late preterm neonates should be screened for iron deficiency earlier than the recommended universal screening at age 1 year for term neonates without risk factors.¹

## 52. A. Greater risk of mortality is associated with severe liver dysfunction, white blood cell count greater than 100 × 10³/mcL, and early age at presentation.

Transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) occurs in 10% of neonates with trisomy 21 and can manifest in utero as early as 26-weeks' gestational age. The prognosis of neonates with TMD diagnosed in utero is more severe than that of neonates receiving the diagnosis in the postnatal period, when spontaneous regression is observed in 80% of cases. Neonates with a prenatal diagnosis have a high risk of intrauterine death (30%), as well as neonatal (10%) and infant (18%) death. Postnatal mortality increases to 90% in neonates presenting with marked hepatomegaly, hyperechoic liver, and hydrops.¹

For neonates who survive an intrauterine manifestation of the disease or who receive the diagnosis in the postnatal period, higher initial leukocyte and blast counts correlate with an increased risk of hepatic, cardiac, and respiratory dysfunction. Treatment with cytarabine and/or rasburicase, exchange transfusion or leukopheresis, and hyperhydration are reserved for neonates with life-threatening complications, including heart and respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and blast cell count greater than 100 × 10³/mcL. Overall, 77% of patients with a postnatal diagnosis of TMD survive to age 3 years.²

Twenty percent to 25% of neonates with TMD will develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, typically before the age of 4 or 5 years.

## 55. C. Immature platelet fraction test

Thrombocytopenia is common in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and can result from increased platelet destruction or decreased platelet production.

The only way to assess platelet production directly is via a bone marrow biopsy. Although this is the gold standard test in adults, the procedure is not typically performed in neonates because of technical difficulties. Therefore, techniques to assess platelet production indirectly, including the measurement of thrombopoietin levels, circulating megakaryocyte progenitors, and reticulated platelet percentages (RP%s), have been investigated. Of those techniques, the immature platelet test (IPF), which measures the RP% equivalent, is the only test currently available for clinical use. IPF levels are high in disorders of increased platelet destruction and low in disorders of decreased production. However, the use of IPF testing in the neonatal population requires more study to determine normative values and potential clinical utility.¹⁻³

## 56. D. Prenatal diagnosis of TMD can be challenging because some ultrasonographic findings associated with TMD are nonspecific and can be associated with congenital infections.

Transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) can manifest prenatally (as early as 26-weeks’ gestational age) and postnatally.

Neonates with prenatal presentation have a worse prognosis, with high prenatal and postnatal mortality. The prenatal diagnosis is challenging because many of the ultrasonographic findings are nonspecific and are also seen with fetal infections. In these cases, limited data indicate that intrauterine fetal blood transfusion may be a therapeutic option in neonates with anemia and thrombocytopenia.¹

Most neonates with postnatal presentations (80%) will experience spontaneous regression without medical intervention. Therefore, chemotherapy with cytarabine or exchange transfusion is considered only in neonates with life-threatening complications.²

Although the presence of mutations in GATA1 may be necessary for the development of TMD, the mutations are not found before 25-weeks’ gestational age. In addition, there is no consensus on the treatment of neonates without symptoms with GATA1 mutation (silent TMD).

Answers

58. A. Because sacrococcygeal tumors are highly vascular, larger tumors in the fetus may lead to high-output cardiac failure and anemia.

Teratomas are the most common tumors seen in neonates and are typically diagnosed with routine prenatal ultrasonography. Most teratomas are isolated and benign and occur in the sacrococcygeal and mediastinal area.

Sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs) are the most common form of neonatal teratoma (35%–60% of cases) and have a marked female predominance (4:1). They are highly vascular tumors that can be associated with high-output cardiac failure, anemia, and hydrops when large enough. Thirty percent of SCTs are mature, 10% have yolk sac tumor elements, and 60% are immature. The risk of malignancy increases with age and is less than 10% at birth compared with 75% after age 1 year.¹²

59. C. Sickle cell anemia is caused by homozygous HbSS or by coinheritance of HbS with another β-globin variant.

Sickle cell anemia (hemoglobin [Hb]S) is the most common hemoglobinopathy in the United States. A single base mutation of adenine to thymine results in the replacement of glutamic acid at codon 6 to valine on the β-globin gene (α₂β₂ᵗⱼˡᵉᵒˣˠˢᵗ). The mutation is more common in descendants from Africa, Central and South America, the Middle East, India, and the Mediterranean. Sickle cell trait occurs in 1 in 12 blacks, whereas sickle cell disease affects 1 in 500 blacks compared with 1 in 36,000 Hispanic Americans.¹²

Sickle cell anemia occurs when both genes are affected (homozygous state, HbSS), whereas sickle cell trait occurs when 1 gene is affected (HbAS). HbSS accounts for 60% to 70% of sickle cell disease, whereas the remaining cases are caused by coinheritance of HbS with another β-globin variant, including the following:

- HbC, leading to HbSC disease
- β-thalassemia, leading to sickle cell-β⁰-thalassemia or sickle cell-β⁺-thalassemia

Because this β-globin gene mutation does not affect the production of HbF (α₂δ₂), neonates typically do not have symptoms. Symptoms begin several months after birth and coincide with a decrease in HbF and an increase in HbS levels. Swelling of the hands and feet (dactylitis) is often the first manifestation of sickle cell anemia but does not occur in the neonatal period. HbSS and sickle cell-β⁰-thalassemia have the most severe phenotypes, whereas HbSC and sickle cell-β⁺-thalassemia have a milder phenotype.³⁴

60. D. Preservative and additive solutions are added to the RBC component to reduce hemolysis and extend storage to approximately 35 to 42 days.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are often necessary to treat extremely low-birth-weight neonates with anemia. The process of RBC collection and storage is important to consider because of metabolic changes that occur.

After separation from platelet-rich plasma, preservatives (CPD, CP2D, CPDA-1) and additives (AS-1, AS-3, AS-5) are added to store the RBCs for a maximum of 35 to 42 days. Stored RBC units have a goal hematocrit of 55% to 65%. Multiple metabolic changes occur during storage, including the following:

- Decreased adenosine triphosphate
- Decreased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, resulting in increased oxygen affinity and decreased tissue oxygen delivery
- Oxidative changes
- Potassium accumulation

Before transfusion, RBC units are irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease and undergo leukoreduction to decrease transmission of cytomegalovirus.³

Those include exclusive breastfeeding, a family history of jaundice in a neonate, bruising or cephalohematoma, male sex, younger gestational age, maternal race, and maternal age older than 25 years, as well as history of vacuum extraction or use of oxytocin in the mother.¹⁻³ Of those risk factors, breastfeeding and gestational age are the strongest clinical predictors of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

## 62. E. TMD occurs in up to 10% of patients with Down syndrome.

Transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) occurs in 10% of neonates with trisomy 21 and requires 2 genetic abnormalities: (1) trisomy of the ERG gene on chromosome 21 and (2) a GATA1 gene mutation. It can occur in neonates with complete or partial trisomy 21, as well as mosaicism for trisomy 21.¹

Most neonates present in the postnatal period (&gt;95%). Prenatal onset of TMD can occur and may manifest as severe hepatomegaly with or without splenomegaly, hydrops, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. However, fetuses with known trisomy 21 are more likely to develop hydrops for reasons other than TMD.²

## 63. A. Cyclical changes in bilirubin concentration in the first 2 months after birth that require intermittent phototherapy

Review of data from the USA Kernicterus Registry indicates that neonates with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can exhibit 5 distinct patterns of bilirubin increase¹:

- Slow postnatal increase in bilirubin levels (&lt; 95th percentile) during the first week, which resolves with a maturing bilirubin elimination system
- Predischarge total serum bilirubin (TSB) level less than the 75th percentile, with exacerbation by starvation, dehydration, unrecognized sepsis, or being late preterm and progression to a TSB level greater than the 95th percentile
- Early-onset hyperbilirubinemia: TSB level greater than the 75th percentile with rapid increase (&gt;0.2 mg/dL/h) and good response to timely intensive phototherapy
- Prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (&gt;2 weeks of age)
- Dramatic, acute-onset excessive hyperbilirubinemia with TSB level increase greater than 1 mg/dL/h, often concurrent with the patterns just described

## 64. C. Turnover of heme precursors

Our understanding of the origin of bilirubin is based on isotopic labeling studies in experimental animals. Results from these studies indicate that the earliest fraction of bilirubin is derived from the rapid turnover of the pool of hemoproteins and heme precursors followed by ineffective erythropoiesis and later red blood cell senescence and degradation.¹

## 69. D. Normal saline

Partial exchange transfusion is a therapeutic option in neonates with severe, symptomatic polycythemia. During a partial exchange transfusion procedure, the volume of blood replacement is calculated with the goal of reducing the central hematocrit to 50% to 55%. Although other solutions (5% albumin, fresh frozen plasma, and commercially available solutions of human plasma protein fraction) have been studied, normal saline is the fluid of choice for partial exchange transfusion in neonates with polycythemia. $^{1,2}$

## 70. A. 8 weeks

Erythropoietin production and thereby endogenous erythropoiesis markedly decrease after birth, resulting in a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) starting at the end of the first postnatal week. Hb concentration continues to decrease thereafter because of decreased erythropoiesis, decreased erythrocyte life span, and increased blood volume. Term neonates reach their Hb nadir at approximately 8 weeks after birth, with an average Hb concentration of 11.2 g/dL (112 g/L).¹

IMMUNOLOGY

1. C. Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome

Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the mevalonate kinase gene located on chromosome 12q24.¹² Infants with hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome typically present by 6 months of age with episodic fevers that are triggered by immunizations or stressful events and last several days.³ Affected infants also can have a maculopapular rash, vomiting, diarrhea, edema, arthritis, and oral ulcers during these episodes.³ Laboratory findings include an elevated white blood cell count and anemia. Treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors, or interleukin-1 inhibitors has been successful in some patients. A severe form of hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome is mevalonic aciduria.

2. B. Hepatitis B vaccine administration is delayed compared with that in term neonates.

In general, preterm neonates who are medically stable should receive vaccinations at the same chronological age as do term neonates. One exception to this rule is that neonates born less than 2,000 g to women who are hepatitis B surface antigen negative should receive the first hepatitis B vaccine either at 1 month of age or at the time of hospital discharge, whichever occurs first.¹

The vaccine dose should not be reduced for preterm neonates nor should the dose be divided into aliquots. The optimal administration site in preterm neonates who receive intramuscular vaccines is the anterolateral area of the thigh. Many large studies have found that vaccine administration does not increase the risk for sudden infant death syndrome or autism in term or preterm neonates.

3. A. HNA-1a

Alloimmune neonatal neutropenia (ANN) occurs when the neonate inherits a human neutrophil antigen (HNA) from the father that is distinct from those of the mother. In utero, the foreign fetal neutrophil antigens enter the maternal circulation, inducing the maternal production of immunoglobulin G antibodies that are then passed back to the fetus and can destroy fetal neutrophils. The degree of fetal neutropenia depends on several factors,¹⁻³ including the:

- Amount of maternal antibodies in the fetal circulation
- Subclass of maternal antibodies
- Fetal reticuloendothelial phagocytic function
- Fetal bone marrow response to produce neutrophils

Many different types of antigenic targets have been implicated in patients with ANN. In the United States, approximately 50% of affected neonates have antibodies that bind to the HNA-1a, HNA-1b, or HNA-2a types.⁴

Neonates born to women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can have neonatal lupus syndrome if there is transplacental transfer of the antinuclear antibodies anti-Sjögren syndrome A (SSA/Ro) and anti-Sjögren syndrome B (SSB/La). Common clinical manifestations of this syndrome¹ include the following:

Answers

- Rash (papulosquamous erythematous lesions with central clearing associated with a fine scale, most commonly involving the face and scalp, as well as other areas)
- Thrombocytopenia
- Direct hyperbilirubinemia
- Mildly elevated liver function test results

Less common manifestations include anemia, neutropenia, central nervous system vasculitis, bradyarrhythmias, myocarditis, glomerulonephritis, pneumonitis, cerebral dysgenesis, rhizomelia, and optic nerve hypoplasia.

Approximately 30% of women with SLE also have antiphospholipid antibodies. Transplacental transfer of these antibodies can lead to intrauterine growth restriction and preterm birth. Affected neonates are also at greater risk for neonatal thromboses, particularly if there are other risk factors for thromboses.² In this scenario, the neonate does not have any classic findings of neonatal lupus syndrome but does have findings that are consistent with acquisition of antiphospholipid antibodies.

In humans, the fetal liver contains pre-B cells as early as 7 weeks' gestation and immature B cells that express surface immunoglobulin (sIg)M by 9 weeks' gestation.¹ The bone marrow contains pre-B cells by 12 weeks' gestation with expression of sIgA, sIgG, and sIgD. Plasma cells are initially found at 20 weeks' gestation. By 22 weeks' gestation, fetuses have an amount of B cells in the spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood similar to that in adults.² By 30 weeks' gestation, the bone marrow becomes the only site for B-cell maturation, and B cells are no longer found in the liver. After birth, the number of B cells increases, with a peak at 3 to 4 months of age, decreasing to adult levels by age 6 to 7 years.³

- Defects in the cytokine signal transduction pathway (eg, Janus kinase 3) → failure of lymphocyte development and T-cell differentiation in the thymus
- Defects in the recombination activating gene RAG1 or RAG2 → failure to develop T-cell receptors
- Defects in the DNA repair enzymes (part of V(D)J recombination) → failure to develop T-cell receptors
- Defects in the major histocompatibility complex class II → T-cell death because of inappropriate T-cell receptor mediated survival signals
- Deletion of 22q11.2 or deletion in Forkhead box N1 → T-cell lymphopenia as a result of abnormal development of the thymus

## 8. E. The development of the stratum corneum begins between 32 and 34 weeks of gestation.

Preterm neonates have deficits in every part of their immune system. Skin keratinization is delayed in neonates born preterm because the development of the stratum corneum begins between 32 and 34 weeks of gestation and matures within 2 weeks after birth. Preterm neonates have decreased complement activity, lower neutrophil stores, and decreased neutrophil adhesion. This population also has decreased activity of CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as decreased maternal transfer of immunoglobulin G that occurs in the third trimester. All neonates have a decrease in gastric acidity that occurs after birth, inhibiting the immune ability of the stomach.

Primary infantile systemic lupus erythematosus is uncommon and primarily involves the renal and pulmonary systems, with manifestations such as pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary capillaritis, glomerulonephritis, and nephrotic syndrome.¹² Neonates with this primary form require aggressive immunosuppression.

Common clinical findings in neonates with neonatal lupus erythematosus include thrombocytopenia, erythematous rash with central clearing, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and abnormal liver function test results. Affected neonates can also have multiple organ involvement, including glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, pneumonitis, anemia, and abnormal cerebral development.

## 10. B. An important aspect of interpreting screening results is that preterm newborns are expected to have a higher false-positive rate than are term newborns.

Newborn screening can be used to diagnose severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) by measuring the T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) by using polymerase chain reaction. If there is a low amount of TRECs, the integrity of the DNA is determined by measuring beta-actin levels. If the TREC amount is low and there is a normal amount of beta-actin, the result is abnormal and confirmation with flow cytometry is required to quantify the lymphocyte subsets. This approach to diagnosing SCID can be used even if the genetic cause is unknown.¹

The presence of maternal T cells in the newborn does not affect the results because these peripherally expanded cells have low TREC levels.

Preterm newborns have an increased false-positive rate of screening results for SCID compared with that of term newborns, so preterm newborns with a low TREC amount and normal beta-actin level should undergo repeat TREC screening closer to a postmenstrual age of 40 weeks' gestation.²

## 13. C. Preterm neonates have lower serum IgG concentrations, with lower nadirs that occur sooner after delivery.

Immunoglobulin (Ig) G is actively transferred from the pregnant woman to the fetus by means of receptor-mediated endocytosis across the placenta. Because this process is active, fetal IgG concentrations may be higher than those in pregnant women. Preterm neonates are deficient in IgG because most of the IgG transfer occurs during the late second trimester and throughout the third trimester.¹ After birth, IgG is catabolized, and concentrations in both term and preterm neonates decrease to a nadir between 3 and 5 months of age. The preterm neonate usually has a lower nadir that occurs at an earlier chronological age.

## 15. B. Cardiocyte apoptosis

Congenital heart block occurs in 1% to 2% of neonates born to women with antinuclear Sjögren syndrome A/Ro and antinuclear Sjögren syndrome B/La antibodies.¹ The mechanism for the conduction injury associated with these maternal antibodies starts with cardiocyte apoptosis, which is a normal part of fetal cardiac development.²,³ The maternal antibodies then bind to the surface of the cardiocytes, attracting macrophages to the site.²,⁵ The subsequent secretion of several fibrosis-promoting factors leads to irreversible fibrosis of the fetal cardiac conduction pathways.²,³

# 16. D. Pregnancy-induced hypertension

The most common cause of neutropenia in neonates during the first postnatal week is decreased neutrophil production secondary to pregnancy-induced hypertension. $^{1,2}$  Thus, in neonates who appear well but have neutropenia (neutrophil count  $&lt; 1.0 \times 10^{3} / \mathrm{mcL}$ $[1.0 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}]$ ) who are born to women with this condition, further evaluation is usually considered only if neutropenia persists beyond 5 to 7 days.

Other causes of neonatal neutropenia include the following:

- Decreased neutrophil production

- Bone marrow failure such as Kostmann syndrome and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome
- Maternal conditions such as diabetes mellitus
Some viral infections

- Increased neutrophil destruction

- Immune-mediated processes such as alloimmune neonatal neutropenia or congenital autoimmune neutropenia
- Microbial infections

- Increased margination of neutrophils

- Drug-induced neutropenia
Some infections
- Idiopathic neutropenia

Chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome, also known as neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, has 3 common clinical manifestations $^{1,2}$ :

1. Chronic aseptic meningitis (lumbar puncture demonstrates prominent neutrophilia)
2. Rash (urticarial, migratory, maculopapular—usually noted at birth)
3. Metaphyseal skeletal dysplasia (usually involving long bones and large joints, seen in  $50\%$  of affected infants within the first few months after birth)

Periodic fevers, ocular involvement (conjunctivitis, uveitis, or papilledema), progressive hearing loss, and dysmorphic features (frontal bossing and saddle nose) also often occur.

Definitive treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant to replace the infant's abnormal immune system with healthy cells. $^{1,2}$  If patients are not severely immunocompromised, pretransplant chemotherapy is beneficial because it helps to open up sites within the bone marrow for donor cells to be deposited and also reduces the risk of graft rejection. $^{3}$  Outcomes are better if the donor is matched to the patient's human leukocyte antigen $^{2}$  and if the transplant occurs early in life, before any infections occur. $^{4}$  Before transplant, enzyme replacement for patients with ADA deficiency can partially restore the infant's immune system. $^{5}$  Retrovirus-mediated gene therapy is being investigated as a possible alternative to stem cell transplants for patients with ADA deficiency.

# 19. C. Rotavirus is a common pathogen, with most children infected by 3 years of age, with outbreaks in NICUs having been reported.

Rotavirus is a common pathogen that infects almost all children by 3 years of age.¹ Outbreaks of rotavirus infection have occurred in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), and there have been reports of a temporal association with necrotizing enterocolitis.¹ A tetravalent rhesus-based rotavirus vaccine used in 1998 was associated with an increased risk of intussusception and was withdrawn.² Currently, there are 2 vaccines available in the United States: a human-bovine reassortant vaccine and a monovalent, live attenuated vaccine that are not associated with an increased risk of intussusception. Since 2006, rotavirus immunization in the United States has decreased neonatal hospitalizations by an estimated 1.5 million.³

Both types of vaccines are associated with shedding in stool, raising concerns for possible rotavirus transmission via the fecal-oral route.² Because of this risk, most NICUs withhold the rotavirus vaccine until discharge, with the first dose recommended between 42 and 104 days.⁴ This approach has led to delayed or missed rotavirus immunizations in preterm neonates, prompting some NICUs to vaccinate preterm neonates during their NICU stay.⁵

# 20. D. Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule

Numerous molecules are involved in the process of neutrophil recruitment to inflamed tissues. The first step (neutrophil rolling with binding to and release from inflamed endothelium) is mediated by selectin ligands (L-selectin on neutrophils and E- or P-selectin on endothelial cells).¹ Neutrophils are then able to attach to the endothelium through the binding of neutrophil beta₂ or leukocyte integrins (eg, leukocyte function-associated antigen-1) to receptors on the endothelial cells (eg, intercellular adhesion molecule-1).² Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecules are important for the transendothelial migration of neutrophils during the final step.

22. D. Pertussis mortality is highest in neonates and infants younger than 6 months, particularly for the youngest who are infected.

The incidence of pertussis infection has been increasing, with the highest rate occurring in neonates and infants younger than 1 year of age. This increase is partly because of waning immunity in adults, as well as delays in diagnosis because of atypical symptoms in adults (chronic cough that is not consistent with the classic whooping episodes). Infants receive the first pertussis vaccine at 2 months' chronological age and thus are unprotected from pertussis for an extended period, leading to increased mortality in neonates and infants younger than 6 months of age who are infected. Preterm neonates are particularly vulnerable and have higher rates of hospitalizations and need for intensive care.

23. C. The age of a neonate determines antibody response more than does the neonate's gestational age; therefore, vaccinations within the first few days after delivery will generally produce a poor immune response.

The amount of antibody response that occurs after immunizations is determined by a neonate's chronological age rather than the neonate's gestational age. Thus, the timing of vaccinations should not be corrected for gestational age, and most vaccination schedules start at 2 months of age.

Marginal zone B cells are the primary responders for encapsulated organisms; these cells are restricted to the spleen, and very few are present at birth. The humoral immune response to encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) is delayed past the time of birth. The naive nature of the adaptive immune system at birth also inhibits neonates from mounting an adequate immune response to foreign antigens.

Azurophilic granules contain myeloperoxidase, proteolytic enzymes (eg, cathepsins, elastase), and antimicrobial proteins (eg, defensins and bactericidal permeability increasing proteins). In contrast, the smaller specific granules contain bacteria-destroying compounds such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, and complement fragment receptors. The content in azurophilic granules assists with intracellular killing of bacteria, whereas the content of specific granules is important for extracellular killing. $^{1}$

## 26. C. Hyperimmune globulin infusions

Some studies investigating hyperimmune globulin infusions suggest a possible benefit of preventing sepsis in very low-birth-weight neonates, and clinical trials with antistaphylococcal immunoglobulins are ongoing.¹,²

Pasteurized donor human milk does not decrease the risk of infections in neonates; this lack of immunologic benefit is likely related to the processing or pasteurization process of banked human milk.³,⁴

Four trials examined the benefit of granulocyte transfusions administered in neonates with sepsis and neutropenia. Although none of these trials showed an improvement in survival, a meta-analysis of these studies concluded that the data were insufficient to recommend or refute the use of granulocyte transfusions.⁵

Administration of myeloid colony-stimulating factors, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, does not decrease mortality in neonates with sepsis.⁶ A large randomized controlled trial assessed the early postnatal use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as prophylaxis for reduction of sepsis in extremely preterm neonates (PROGRAMS trial).⁷ Although this stimulating factor led to an improvement in neutropenia, there was no reduction in sepsis or mortality.⁷

Immunization with T-cell-dependent protein antigens is ineffective in preterm and term neonates because the neonatal antibody response is weak early in life.

## 27. E. Thrombocytopenia

There are 3 main clinical manifestations of neonatal lupus syndrome:

- Rash (erythematous lesions with central pallor)
- Thrombocytopenia
- Direct hyperbilirubinemia with mild transaminitis

These clinical findings typically resolve over time as maternal autoantibodies disappear from the neonatal circulation. Neonatal lupus syndrome can also involve other organs such as the heart (eg, heart block, myocarditis, endocarditis), kidneys (eg, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome), lungs (pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage), and brain (eg, cerebral dysmaturation or dysgenesis). Some of these manifestations may have long-term effects.

## 28. B. No symptoms

Although neonates with autoimmune neutropenia of infancy have primary neutropenia as a result of autoantibodies (similar to immune thrombocytopenic purpura), neonates with neonatal autoimmune neutropenia acquire maternal autoantibodies during gestation that destroy fetal neutrophils.¹,²

Autoimmune neutropenia of infancy leads to neutropenia associated with minor infections (eg, otitis media, respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, cellulitis) and typically resolves by 4 years of age.³ In contrast, neonates with neonatal alloimmune neutropenia have transient neutropenia that resolves within a few months of age, and affected patients usually have no symptoms.

## 30. A. Apnea before administration of vaccines

Mild and transient episodes of apnea and bradycardia can occur in preterm neonates after immunization with the following vaccines: Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliovirus, hepatitis B virus, and pneumococcal conjugate.¹ Recent studies suggest that although whole-cell pertussis vaccine might be associated with apnea, this risk decreases with the use of acellular pertussis vaccine.² The most significant factor associated with postimmunization apnea is apnea occurring before vaccine administration.³ Neonates with a high score on the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology at 12 hours of age, a younger age (younger than 67 days), and a lower birth weight (&lt; 2,000 g) were also at greater risk for postimmunization apnea.³

## 33. A. Apneic events associated with acellular pertussis vaccination have not been shown consistently, and recent reports suggest that apnea is more likely related to the infant's clinical status.

Globally, studies have found lower immunization rates in neonates born preterm, particularly in extremely low-birth-weight neonates. In studies from the United States and Canada, this lower rate was most significant at 2 months of age and persisted at 6 months of age, with improvement by age 12 months.¹² Part of this delay is the erroneous belief that preterm neonates are unable to tolerate or respond to vaccinations.³

Preterm infants have an increased risk of apnea after the 2-month immunizations, particularly if these episodes occurred preimmunization;⁴ 4-month immunizations have not been associated with an increased risk of apnea.⁵ This potential risk of postimmunization apnea should not lead to a delay in vaccination. Cardiorespiratory events have been implicated most frequently after the whole-cell pertussis vaccine, leading to a delay in pertussis vaccination or mandatory monitoring after vaccination.⁶ Studies have found that this association is lower if the acellular pertussis preparation is used and might be more related to the patient's clinical status rather than the vaccine itself.⁷

In mammals, there are 3 major B-cell subsets with distinct functions:

- Follicular B2 cells provide the adaptive immune response against thymus-dependent antigens; they are responsible for creating high-affinity antibodies that are highly specific to antigens.¹
- B1 cells are found primarily in the peritoneal and pleural cavities; they are part of the innate immune response against thymus-independent antigens and create low-affinity antibodies with broad antigen specificity.² They are the predominant type of B cell in the fetus, with approximately 90% of the total cord blood B cells consisting of CD5+ B cells.
- Marginal zone B cells are found primarily in the spleen; they are part of the innate immune response against thymus-independent antigens and create low-affinity antibodies with broad antigen specificity.²

## 36. A. Cytokines in the thymus transmit growth and differentiation signals that help generate a specific T-cell receptor for each T cell.

During fetal hematopoiesis, T-cell precursors develop in the fetal liver and then in the bone marrow. These precursors then migrate to the thymus where cytokines transmit growth and differentiation signals to help generate a specific T-cell receptor for each T cell. The T-cell receptor locus contains many V, D, and J gene segments. Recombination-activating genes and DNA repair enzymes (eg, DNA ligase) then rearrange the gene segments. As a result, a new linear T-cell receptor locus is created, leading to an extremely diverse group of T-cell receptors that can respond to a large group of antigens. Along with this new T-cell receptor, T-cell receptor excision circles are also created. Molecular defects can occur at any of these steps and lead to severe combined immunodeficiency disorder. $^{1,2}$

## 37. E. X-linked agammaglobulinemia is characterized by near absence of all immunoglobulins.

Abnormalities in the development of B cells lead to multiple different immunodeficiencies. Almost complete absence of all immunoglobulins causes the severe immunodeficiency known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia. This occurs when there are mutations in the Bruton tyrosine kinase gene, which prevents pre-B cells from developing into immature B cells. $^{1}$ This arrest in B-cell development prevents B-cell differentiation and thereby antibody production in response to microbes. $^{1}$ Infants with X-linked agammaglobulinemia are protected from severe infections in the first few months after birth because of transplacental acquisition of maternal antibodies.

X-linked hyper IgM syndrome is a group of disorders caused by CD40 ligand mutations that lead to abnormalities in the immunoglobulin class-switch recombination. Affected patients have high or normal IgM levels and low IgG, IgA, and IgE levels. $^{2}$

Infants with common variable immunodeficiency have decreased serum IgG concentrations and reduced switched memory B cells, leading to an inadequate response to vaccines and decreased ability to switch immunoglobulin classes. $^{3}$

Several medications can affect the chemotaxis ability of neutrophils in neonates.

2. D. Most women who have rubella virus infection manifest fever, coryza, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia. Although congenital rubella syndrome is a rare pregnancy complication in the United States, this disease is common in countries that lack routine rubella immunization.¹ In the United States, newborns of Hispanic immigrants are at greater risk of congenital rubella syndrome than are neonates of other ethnicities.² The frequency of fetal congenital defects is highest (75%) when the infection occurs at less than 8 weeks' gestation and less common if the infection occurs later in pregnancy (50% risk between 9 and 12 weeks' gestation and 20% risk between 13 and 20 weeks' gestation).³ Clinical findings in pregnant women with a rubella infection include a low-grade fever, headache, coryza, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia. Women with a primary rubella infection have rubella-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies, whereas women who are reinfected with rubella have a greater than 4-fold increase in rubella-specific immunoglobulin G antibody titers.

3. E. 2 to 3 days after developing sepsis
C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein used in the evaluation of sepsis in neonates. When sepsis occurs, CRP concentrations are initially increased in less than one-fifth of neonates with infection. Twenty-four hours after an infant develops symptoms consistent with sepsis, levels of this protein are significantly elevated, with peak concentrations occurring 2 to 3 days after infection onset. Therefore, antibiotic therapy should lead to a decrease in inflammation and, correspondingly, the CRP concentrations should decrease; if this does not occur, the neonate may not be responding to antibiotics, perhaps because the pathogen is not sensitive to the antibiotic regimen.¹

4. C. *Escherichia coli*
Because intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group B *Streptococcus* has become standard, the incidence of early-onset sepsis caused by gram-negative organisms has increased. *Escherichia coli* is the most common gram-negative organism that causes early-onset sepsis in preterm neonates.¹⁻³ The pathogenesis of early-onset sepsis is most often attributable to ascending colonization in the setting of rupture of membranes. This can then lead to intra-amniotic fetal infection or fetal colonization at the time of delivery. Early-onset neonatal sepsis caused by *Listeria monocytogenes* is unique because it is spread hematogenously across the placenta.

5. D. Soft-tissue swelling

In newborns with osteomyelitis, the soft-tissue swelling around the involved bone is the first abnormality to manifest at radiography. As the infection progresses, necrosis within the bone is apparent. Radiographic evidence of bone destruction appears at approximately 7 to 10 days from the onset of the infection, earlier than it does in older children. If the adjacent joint is involved, joint swelling and a widened joint space can be visible.

6. D. This finding may also be associated with histologically visible lesions on the surface of the umbilical cord of wedge-shaped, microabscesses containing yeast, hyphae, and neutrophils.

Invasive Candida disease in a neonate is uncommon. Because affected neonates have similar clinical findings, unlike neonates with bacterial infections, umbilical cord pathological assessment is helpful in diagnosing Candida infection. The pathological findings described in this vignette are consistent with Candida infection. Grossly, the infected umbilical cord demonstrates cream-colored 2- to 3-mm macules. Histological findings of the umbilical cord of a neonate with invasive Candida disease will demonstrate pathognomonic wedge-shaped microabscesses containing yeast, hyphae, and neutrophils.

7. E. The time to positivity for the blood culture was 14 hours after the culture was obtained.

Several factors can help in distinguishing between a true coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species infection and contamination. A true infection is more likely in the following scenarios¹:

- Blood cultures from a peripheral site and central line both positive for the same organism
- Greater than 50 colony-forming units/mL
- Repeat blood culture positive for the same organism but obtained before antibiotics
- Time to positive blood culture of less than 15 hours
- Elevated inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein
- Clinical symptoms consistent with sepsis

8. D. Purulent material from the groin

The preferred method for diagnosing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is to obtain a culture from the affected site. In the vignette, a culture of the neonate's groin lesion will most likely indicate MRSA infection. If a neonate has systemic findings, cultures should be obtained from the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.

10. A. Decreased central line-associated bloodstream infection risk has been reported when there is a dedicated team for central venous catheter insertion, particularly for peripherally inserted central catheters.

Changes in care practices in neonatal intensive care units can affect the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) significantly. There are 3 main approaches to decrease the CLABSI rate¹,²:

1. Promote hand hygiene
2. Optimize insertion, use, and removal of the central line, including the following:

- Criteria for line insertion and removal
- A dedicated team for line insertion
- Checklists for insertion procedure and monitoring of the line

- A maximal sterile barrier during placement, with use of mask, hat, sterile gown, sterile gloves, and sterile drapes
- A 2-person process for dressing changes and line maintenance (1 person is sterile and the other nonsterile)
- Established length of time to “scrub the hub” (current recommendation is 15 seconds)
- Interval guidelines for tubing changes: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends line changes every 96 hours for most fluids except for lipid-containing lines that should be changed every 24 hours, as well as administration of blood products that requires a line change with each infusion³

3. Monitor compliance

The best practice for CLABSI prevention combines hand hygiene followed by use of sterile gloves for line insertion and daily maintenance.

Group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli are the 2 most common causes of neonatal meningitis, accounting for two-thirds of proven cases. As a result of increasing antimicrobial resistance to these 2 pathogens, current initial antibiotic treatment in neonates suspected of having sepsis or meningitis should include ampicillin and gentamicin. A third-generation cephalosporin should be considered if there is high risk of gram-negative bacilli infection (eg, maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis). This empiric treatment should be modified based on organism sensitivity. No vaccines currently are approved during pregnancy to prevent meningitis.

13. D. Intrauterine and intrapartum transmission are the most common routes of acquisition of HCV in children.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease. Intrauterine and intrapartum transmission are the most common routes of acquisition of HCV in children. Pregnant women who acquire HCV infection usually have no symptoms. HCV RNA has been found in human milk at extremely low levels, so breastfeeding is not contraindicated in women infected with HCV. At present, there is no medication available to reduce the perinatal transmission of HCV.

## 14. D. Intravenous acyclovir is recommended for severe infections.

Intravenous acyclovir is the drug of choice for pregnant women with severe varicella infections, whereas oral acyclovir is recommended for routine infections. For pregnant women with zoster infection, acyclovir is recommended only if the lesions are severe or painful. Acyclovir is most effective if therapy for the pregnant woman is initiated within 1 day of the onset of varicella symptoms or within 3 days of zoster lesions.¹ There are insufficient studies examining the use of the antiviral foscarnet for use in pregnant women with varicella. For pregnant women who are not infected and not immune, the varicella vaccine should be administered postpartum, even in breastfeeding women.²

Precautions for airborne organisms are needed to prevent the transmission of varicella-zoster virus, measles, and pulmonary tuberculosis.

For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus that are spread by contact, health care workers should wear a gown and gloves (and possibly a mask for RSV) to prevent transmission.¹ Because pertussis spreads via respiratory droplets over short distances, hospital personnel should use a mask for protection.¹ Personnel caring for a neonate with adenovirus need to use contact and droplet precautions, which include gloves, gown, and mask.¹

Because this neonate has clinical findings of sepsis in the setting of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) growth from both the peripheral and central line blood cultures, he most likely has a true CoNS infection. Methicillin resistance is found in 90% of CoNS isolates, so vancomycin is the preferred first-line antibiotic for neonatal CoNS infection.¹,² If a central line is still required in the setting of a CoNS infection, it can remain in place because studies have found that almost 50% of cases can be cleared with antibiotics alone.³ If there are more than 3 positive central line cultures, physicians should strongly consider removal of the central line.

22. E. The goal of HCV treatment is undetectable viral RNA in the blood approximately 6 months after discontinuation of interferon therapies and approximately 3 months after discontinuation of direct-acting antivirals.

The goal of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment is to decrease serum viral RNA to undetectable levels in the blood approximately 6 months after discontinuation of interferon therapies and approximately 3 months after discontinuation of direct-acting antivirals. Direct-acting antivirals are administered orally. Women of reproductive age who are HCV positive should be treated for HCV before pregnancy because antiviral therapy is not currently recommended in pregnant women because of lack of efficacy and limited safety data.¹ Ribavirin use in pregnant women who are HCV positive has teratogenic effects.² Children with hepatitis C infection can receive pegylated interferon with ribavirin, with the length of treatment ranging from 24 to 48 weeks, depending on the genotype.¹

24. A. Breast

Clinical manifestations of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in the neonate include pustulosis, cellulitis, abscess, and invasive disease (eg, osteomyelitis, arthritis, pneumonia, meningitis).¹ Pustulosis involves a collection of pus with lesions that are less than 1 cm in diameter, and an abscess is a collection of pus of 1 cm in diameter or more. The breast is the most common site for abscess formation in neonatal MRSA infections, whereas pustulosis can involve any part of the skin.

25. E. VariZIG is recommended in any patients who are immunocompromised and not immune.

After a patient is exposed to varicella, the administration of varicella-zoster immune globulin (VariZIG) is effective at preventing varicella infection and is recommended in the following scenarios¹:

- Any person who is immunocompromised and not immune
- Newborns born to women with symptoms of a varicella virus infection 5 days before delivery and until 2 days after delivery
- Hospitalized preterm newborns born younger than 28-weeks’ gestational age or with birth weight less than 1,000 g
- Pregnant women who are not immune

VariZIG significantly decreases the mortality rate of newborns at high risk for varicella infection. Of note, newborns cannot receive the varicella-zoster vaccine.

# 29. E. Target treatment to TB-endemic areas of the world

Most current cases of tuberculosis (TB) result from activation of latent TB infection (LTBI), which is when a person has the bacteria but lacks clinical findings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Thoracic Society have emphasized that the successful elimination of TB can best be accomplished by focusing on eradicating LTBI and targeting treatment to TB-endemic areas of the world.[1,2]

# 30. B. Clostridium perfringens

Animal studies suggest that commensal intestinal flora is important for intestinal development, barrier function, and immune function, as well as epithelial proliferation and survival. Commensal bacteria are also likely to inhibit inflammation and decrease pathogenic microbial growth.[1,2] Preterm birth causes early bacterial colonization, which can be perturbed further by antibiotic exposure, leading to a decreased amount of bacteria or growth of atypical organisms. Human studies have shown that very low-birth-weight neonates have an abnormal amount of *Colstridium perfringens* in their stool that is associated with a higher risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis.[3,4]

## 31. C. Gestational immaturity

Candida is the third most common pathogen responsible for sepsis beyond 72 hours of age in very low-birth-weight neonates. Young gestational age and low birth weight are the 2 most significant risk factors for acquiring a Candida infection in the neonate who is hospitalized. Other risk factors are endotracheal intubation, central venous catheter use, parenteral nutrition, and medications such as corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

## 32. D. Reasons that coagulase-negative staphylococci may be common in CLABSIs include that they are practically a universal colonizer of skin in neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit and are also further selected by resistance to most antibiotics routinely administered to these neonates.

The most common organism that contributes to central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in neonates is coagulase-negative staphylococci. This organism colonizes the skin of almost all patients in the neonatal intensive care unit and is resistant to most antibiotics. Other common microbes are enterococci, Candida, and gram-negative organisms. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-sensitive S aureus are prevalent in 1% to 5% and 20% to 30% of healthy adults in the United States, respectively. These gram-positive organisms produce compounds that help them adhere to catheter surfaces. In contrast, gram-negative organisms contribute to less than 10% of CLABSIs in neonates.

## 33. A. Hand hygiene before and after every patient contact

Direct or indirect contact is the primary transmission route of pathogens in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The most effective method of preventing a nosocomial infection in this environment is to ensure that clinical care providers practice meticulous hand hygiene before and after every patient interaction. Other strategies that can decrease nosocomial infections in the NICU include:

- Removal of all jewelry distal to the elbows¹,²
- Wearing masks to avoid contact with respiratory secretions

Studies have not found that surgical scrubbing before entry into the NICU affects the nosocomial infection rate.³ Similarly, there is no evidence that universally wearing gloves for all patient contact decreases the rate of nosocomial infections, and 1 study suggests that this practice may be associated with poor hand hygiene between uses of gloves.⁴

## 34. A. Cefotaxime

The 2011 surveillance program from the British Health Protection Agency reported that 95% of organisms found in infants with late-onset sepsis were sensitive to treatment with gentamicin with either flucloxacillin or amoxicillin.¹ Broader-spectrum coverage with cefotaxime provides less coverage for organisms associated with late-onset sepsis (79% susceptibility), increases the risk of developing antibiotic resistance, and is associated with a greater risk of fungal infections. However, cefotaxime has superior penetration in the cerebrospinal fluid, making it effective for infants suspected of having meningitis.

## 35. D. Liver

Congenital tuberculosis (TB) is rare and occurs when the pregnant woman has recently acquired TB either immediately before the pregnancy or during the pregnancy. A pregnant woman with TB can infect the fetus by means of hematogenous spread across the placenta and into the umbilical vein. Blood flow from the umbilical vein then enters the liver, which is the first organ infected with bacteria.

36. B. In the case of early ascending infection, the pregnant woman may be infected with bacteria and develop an inflammatory response with symptoms such as fever, but the fetus may not yet be infected. There are many different reasons for maternal fever at the time of delivery. If the pregnant woman is infected with bacteria, she may develop an inflammatory response with symptoms such as fever, but the fetus may not yet be infected. In combination with clinical findings, the placental pathological findings (eg, lack of fetal inflammation or histological evidence of Candida infection) can be helpful in guiding the treatment decisions for a newborn.

37. E. One potential limitation in interpretation of studies that have shown an association of CoNS infection with neurodevelopmental delay is the lack of a consistent definition that demonstrates evidence of true clinical CoNS infection.

Two large cohort studies have found an association between coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) sepsis and neurodevelopmental abnormalities.¹² However, 1 potential limitation in interpreting these studies is the lack of a consistent definition of a CoNS infection.

38. E. Tachycardia in the absence of external stimuli and hypothermia

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a dysregulation in the normal physiological state evident by alterations in vital signs and laboratory results.¹ The adult definition of SIRS has been modified for application in term neonates and consists of the following:

- Abnormal temperature defined as greater than 38.5°C or less than 36°C
- Tachycardia or bradycardia without any other explanation
- Tachypnea or acute need for mechanical ventilation
- Leukocytosis, leukopenia, or greater than 10% immature neutrophils

Diagnosis requires the presence of at least 2 of these 4 findings, and 1 of these must be an abnormal temperature or white blood cell count. Challenges arise when using this definition in preterm neonates because preterm neonates have unique physiological characteristics.²

39. B. Decreased incidences of severe infections and mortality have been shown with skin-to-skin care in low-resource settings.

Skin-to-skin care has been shown to have several positive effects in neonates who are hospitalized, including the following:²

- Lower incidence of severe infections and decreased mortality with shortened length of stay in low-resource settings
- Improved breastfeeding
- Improved infant growth after discharge
- Increased maternal satisfaction and neonate bonding

Strong evidence is lacking for the use of skin-to-skin care in neonates who are hospitalized and whose condition is unstable.

For families who are able to live in the nursery, studies have shown that parents have greater confidence and efficacy in their care, and neonate length of stay is often decreased.

40. E. Using a multivariable model that takes into account prior probability of sepsis on the basis of multiple variables, including maternal factors, can help to reduce the number of newborns evaluated and empirically treated for EOS.

Multivariable risk models for early-onset sepsis (EOS) are available that begin with the prior probability of sepsis and account for both maternal risk factors known at the time of birth and for the newborn clinical condition from birth through 12 hours of age. Use of clinical algorithms based on such models can help to reduce the number of newborns evaluated and empirically treated for EOS.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that providers should determine the newborn risk assessment for EOS by using maternal and neonatal factors.¹⁻³ One group of authors examined the use of a multivariable model to determine EOS probability on the basis of known risks.⁴ Combining risks, such as length of rupture of membranes, maternal fever, and clinical findings in the newborn, led to a reduction in the number of newborns evaluated and empirically treated for EOS.⁴ The approach of using 1 variable, such as rupture of members more than 18 hours, is less effective because it does not account for interactions among risk factors. Single components of the complete blood cell count or C-reactive protein level are also poor predictors of EOS.

41. D. The suspicion of infection is warranted, considering that hospital-acquired infections, such as CLABSIs, are still prevalent in very low-birth-weight neonates, with higher risk for those at the youngest gestational ages.

The neonate described in this vignette has clinical findings that might be consistent with a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The greatest risk factors for a CLABSI in the neonatal population are young gestational age and low birth weight. There are similar rates of CLABSIs regardless of the type of central line catheter, but the median time to onset of infection is 9 days with umbilical venous catheters and 14 days with peripherally inserted central catheters.¹

42. C. EOS in newborns is mostly caused by rupture of membranes, with ascending colonization leading to intra-amniotic infection.

Early-onset sepsis (EOS) occurs in newborns after rupture of membranes, with ascending colonization leading to intra-amniotic infection. Newborn colonization at the time of delivery can also lead to neonatal infection. Although group B Streptococcus is the most common organism that leads to EOS in term newborns, preterm newborns are most likely to have EOS as a result of Escherichia coli. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has reduced the incidence of EOS group B Streptococcus infection.

43. C. Nonculture tests of cerebrospinal fluid, such as latex agglutination, polymerase chain reaction, microarray, or immunochromatography, may be helpful in cases of previous antibiotic treatment.

The neonate described in this vignette has symptoms that might be consistent with meningitis. When meningitis is suspected in a neonate, the cerebrospinal fluid should be tested as early as possible (ideally, before starting antibiotics). A neonate with bacterial meningitis might have cerebrospinal fluid results that show polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, low glucose concentration, increased protein concentration, and positive culture result.

Nonculture cerebrospinal fluid testing may be helpful if earlier identification of organisms is needed, antibiotics were previously administered, or there is a diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage. Options for this type of testing include latex agglutination, polymerase chain reaction, microarray, or immunochromatography. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method is a promising test that amplifies DNA at isothermic temperatures.

44. E. There is a positive correlation between HCV viral load and risk of perinatal transmission, with pregnant women with a higher HCV RNA load more likely to transmit the virus than are women with low or no viremia.

The most common route of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in neonates is mother-to-neonate vertical transmission. The transmission rate from a pregnant woman who is HCV positive to the fetus is between 7% and 15%. The risk of transmission is greatest in the following situations:

- High maternal HCV viral load³
- High HCV RNA load, even if the pregnant woman has low viremia³
- Maternal coinfection with HIV (increased risk by 3- to 5-fold)⁴; this risk decreases significantly, and might even be protective, if the pregnant woman is receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy⁴
- Female neonate⁵

Factors that are unlikely to affect the risk of HCV mother-to-neonate transmission are:

- Prolonged rupture of membranes or use of fetal scalp electrodes⁶
- Mode of delivery⁵
- Genotype of the virus³

- Race other than white
- High exposure to young children (eg, occupation in childcare)

## 46. A. Bilirubin toxicity

Third-generation cephalosporins can lead to adverse effects, including phlebitis, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms such as emesis and diarrhea, elevated liver function test results, and cholelithiasis. More serious adverse effects include seizure activity, hemolytic anemia, and bone marrow suppression with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.¹ Ceftriaxone can displace bilirubin from albumin and, thus, is not recommended during the first postnatal week.²

A pathologist can provide the neonatologist with useful information about the pathological nature of the placenta. In some cases, it may be beneficial for the pathologist to communicate with the neonatologist. During the assessment of the severity of placental inflammation, the pathologist's standard practice is to use the nomenclature and classification system established in 2003 by the Perinatal Section of the Society for Pediatric Pathology.¹ This approach helps to standardize the pathologist's report, but it is not intended to guide the neonatologist in management decisions such as the need to start antibiotics.

50. A. Hepatomegaly

Almost 80% of newborns with congenital syphilis have symptoms at birth,1 with symptoms typically developing between weeks 3 and 14 after birth. There is a wide spectrum of clinical findings, with early clinical manifestations consisting of the following1:

Hepatosplenomegaly (hepatomegaly is present in almost all affected newborns)Rash (maculopapular desquamating diffuse lesions or vesiculobullous lesions involving the palms and soles, also known as pemphigus syphiliticus)Rhinitis (highly infectious nasal fluid)JaundicePseudoparalysisNephrotic syndrome (as early as 2 to 3 months of age)Hematologic manifestations, such as an elevated or low white blood cell count and/or low platelet countCentral nervous system abnormalities, such as meningitis, hydrocephalus, or seizuresOsteochondritis (usually involving the long bones and ribs)

Stigmas of this early disease lead to late congenital syphilis, with findings such as Hutchinson teeth, saddle nose deformity, retinal and corneal abnormalities, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and joint abnormalities.1

Most affected women were Hispanic and acquired the illness by ingesting a Mexican type of soft cheese.¹ Other listeriosis outbreaks have been described after ingestion of raw vegetables,² coleslaw, and pasteurized milk.³

# 62. C. Elevated lipocalin 2 level in the cerebrospinal fluid

Researchers have investigated whether cerebrospinal biomarkers can be helpful in distinguishing between bacterial and viral meningitis in neonates. Specifically, neonates with bacterial meningitis had higher lipocalin 2 levels, higher lactate concentrations, and higher C-reactive protein levels than did neonates with viral meningitis. However, the clinical utility of these biomarkers is still uncertain because studies have examined a small number of patients and inconsistent assays have been used.

# 63. E. Staphylococcus lugdunensis can be associated with endocarditis and sepsis.

Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus is a gram-positive organism with more than 30 different species, including the following:

- Staphylococcus epidermidis: most predominant species, occurring in almost  $75\%$  of isolates
- S lugdunensis: associated with endocarditis and sepsis
- Staphylococcus saprophyticus: found in the genitourinary tract

Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus is currently the most common organism associated with nosocomial infections, contributing to  $30\%$  of central line infections hospital-wide, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network.2

Although antibiotic use has few immediate adverse effects, exposure to a prolonged course of antibiotics has significant long-term risks in neonates, including the following:

- Alteration of the intestinal microbiome with development of resistant organisms
- Increased risk of Candida infections among preterm neonates, particularly with use of third-generation cephalosporins in very low-birth-weight neonates
- Increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in very low-birth-weight neonates
- Increased risk of late-onset sepsis in very low-birth-weight neonates

- Low birth weight
Length of hospitalization
- Use of parenteral nutrition, particularly if administered for more than 21 days
Mechanical ventilation
- Lack of enteral feeding

66. D. In the United States, most newborns with early-onset GBS sepsis have capsular polysaccharide serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, and V.

Approximately 20% to 30% of women are colonized with group B Streptococcus (GBS). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends routine testing for GBS in pregnant women, with prophylactic intrapartum antibiotics for women who are GBS positive to prevent neonatal GBS sepsis. Early-onset sepsis caused by GBS is most often caused by ascending colonization in the setting of rupture of membranes followed by intra-amniotic infection. In the United States, most newborns with early-onset GBS sepsis have capsular polysaccharide serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, and V.¹

Exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics has been associated with overgrowth of several organisms, including Klebsiella oxytoca, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Clostridium difficile accounts for approximately 10% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and almost all cases of pseudomembranous colitis attributed to antibiotic use.

68. E. Parenteral nutrition

Several studies have found specific risk factors in the development of late-onset sepsis in preterm neonates, including patent ductus arteriosus, chronic lung disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, central line use, and parenteral nutrition.¹⁻³ A 2011 case-control study in the United Kingdom found that, after controlling for gestational age, the primary risk factor for gram-negative late-onset sepsis was the length of administration of parenteral nutrition.⁴

In the preterm neonate, histological evidence of acute chorioamnionitis is a risk factor for sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, and other morbidities, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and meningitis.¹⁻³ The most common route of infection is via the ascending route in which microbes ascend from the cervicovaginal tract into the decidua, the free membranes of the placenta, and then the amniotic fluid.² Common potential organisms include Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, and Fusobacterium, which have low pathogenicity. Organisms with high pathogenicity that have the capacity to invade the central nervous system include Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus, and Listeria monocytogenes.

## 72. E. The temperature is 40°C; the heart rate and respiratory rate are normal; and there is an elevated leukocyte count, with 25% immature neutrophils.

A diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in a neonate requires evidence of physiological and/or laboratory abnormalities.¹ Four categories need to be assessed:

1. Low or high temperature
2. Leukopenia, leukocytosis, or more than 10% immature neutrophils
3. Bradycardia or tachycardia
4. Tachypnea or need for mechanical ventilation without a specific abnormality

The diagnosis of SIRS requires abnormalities in 2 of these categories, and 1 of these needs to be an abnormality in temperature or white blood cell count.¹ Thus, the neonate who has an elevated temperature (40°C) and an elevated leukocyte count meets the criteria for SIRS.

## 73. C. For health care providers, hand hygiene can be performed with chlorhexidine gluconate soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after patient contact, after bodily fluid exposure, and before starting a sterile task.

Research has shown that central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in the neonate who is hospitalized can be significantly decreased, even in patients at risk who are of young gestational age and very low birth weight.¹,² Appropriate hand hygiene is 1 of the most effective methods of decreasing the risk of CLABSIs in this population. Hand hygiene with chlorhexidine gluconate soap and water or alcohol-based liquids is effective at decreasing the amount of microbes and viruses on the hands of hospital personnel. Alcohol-based liquids are less irritating to the skin, but soap and water is better at cleaning hands that are visibly soiled. Chlorhexidine soap and water are better at eradicating Clostridium difficile.

### 76. E. Use of a third-generation cephalosporin should be considered in a neonate born to a mother who received intrapartum group B Streptococcus prophylaxis.

Empiric therapy for presumed neonatal meningitis should be based on the likely organisms, which is determined by chronological age and risk factors. For neonates younger than 1 month of age, a combination of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside is recommended to cover the most common organisms in this population: group B Streptococcus (GBS), Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. For neonates born to women who received intrapartum prophylaxis for GBS or if a gram-negative organism is likely, a third-generation cephalosporin should be considered. Once an organism is identified, the antibiotic regimen can be modified based on susceptibility. For an antibiotic-resistant organism, a repeat lumbar puncture may be warranted to document spinal fluid sterility. Although a 21-day antibiotic regimen is used to treat meningitis, there are no well-controlled trials that support this common practice.

Microbes can also enter hematogenously from the maternal circulation (eg, after dental procedures), by local entry into the uterus from the peritoneum and pelvic regions, by entry into the amniotic sac as a result of a procedure or trauma, or by direct entry into the fetal circulation after an umbilical cord transfusion. These latter mechanisms do not require the rupture of membranes.

## 78. B. Neonates exposed to HCV and infected with HCV should receive hepatitis A and hepatitis B immunizations.

The diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a neonate with intrauterine HCV exposure is challenging because maternal immunoglobulin G antibodies can persist in the neonate's circulation for as long as 18 months. To avoid false-positive anti-HCV immunoglobulin G antibody results, a neonate who is born to a mother with HCV infection should undergo antibody testing at or after 18 months of age.[1,2] For children who have positive antibodies at that age, HCV RNA testing after age 3 years is helpful to confirm chronic active infection.[2] Alternatively, HCV RNA testing can be performed in the first year after birth; although the ideal timing for RNA testing is not known, most experts suggest testing between 1 and 2 months of age.[2] Neonates exposed to HCV and infected with HCV should receive hepatitis A and hepatitis B immunizations because a second cause of infectious hepatitis can increase morbidity and mortality.[1]

## 79. B. Neonates born to mothers with symptoms of varicella 5 days before delivery to 2 days after delivery have a higher fatality rate because of insufficient maternal antibody production and intrauterine transfer.

The risk of a neonate having congenital varicella disease is 24% if the mother was infected with varicella-zoster virus within 21 days of delivery. The neonatal mortality rate is greatest if the mother has symptoms of varicella 5 days before delivery to 2 days after delivery because there is insufficient maternal antibody production and intrauterine transfer to the fetus. Pneumonia is the most common cause of death in neonates with congenital varicella infection. The typical varicella rash consists of vesicles that develop into pustules; bullous or hemorrhagic lesions are less common.

## 80. D. Maternal GBS colonization

Early-onset sepsis as a result of group B *Streptococcus* (GBS) is acquired by means of intrauterine colonization or colonization during vaginal delivery. Without intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, approximately one-half of the neonates born to mothers who are GBS positive are colonized with GBS, with only a small percentage (1% to 2%) of neonates who are colonized developing invasive GBS disease. Although there are many factors that increase the risk of neonatal GBS disease, the greatest risk factor for neonatal GBS disease is maternal GBS colonization.

## 84. D. Lumbar puncture is always required in late-onset sepsis.

It is important to perform lumbar puncture in neonates suspected of having late-onset sepsis (LOS) because up to 25% of neonates with LOS have meningitis and as many as one-half of neonates with meningitis have a negative blood culture.¹,² Ideally, the lumbar puncture should be performed before starting antibiotics but can be deferred if the neonate has hemodynamic instability, thrombocytopenia, or coagulation abnormalities.³ Interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results can be challenging in neonates because there is a high risk for traumatic lumbar puncture (39.5%) and there is variability in normal cytological and biochemical values.⁴ Studies have found that various methods for adjusting CSF white blood cell counts on the basis of CSF red blood cell counts in traumatic lumbar puncture did not improve the ability to diagnose meningitis and the sensitivity was decreased.⁵

Overall, studies have found a decrease in ICI by more than 80% in this population without any effect on fungal resistance, except when high doses (≥ 6 mg/kg) are administered daily.¹⁻³ One randomized controlled trial showed that fluconazole prophylaxis for 6 weeks provided to neonates with a birth weight less than 1,000 g was associated with a lower risk of ICI (0 of 50 patients) compared with results with the placebo group (10 of 50 patients; P = .008).¹ Fluconazole prophylaxis had the greatest effect on preventing colonization or infection of Candida albicans compared with that of other Candida species.¹

1.  E. Placental disease
Using a mouse model of preeclampsia, pregnant mice with preeclampsia early in pregnancy had placental abnormalities, higher fetal mortality, and lower fetal weights.¹ In contrast, late preeclampsia was not associated with placental pathology or change in fetal outcomes. Thus, early preeclampsia is considered a placental disease that affects the fetus, while late preeclampsia likely affects only the pregnant woman.

4.  D. Nuchal translucency
Nuchal translucency is the maximum distance between the soft tissue over the fetal spine and the skin of the fetal neck. This measurement is the primary marker for the detection of fetal aneuploidy; if this measurement is greater than 3 mm, the risk for trisomy 21, 18, and 13 increases.¹ The addition of first-trimester maternal serum analytes to the nuchal translucency measurement improves the chromosomal risk assessment. Secondary markers, such as ductus venosus Doppler waveform, frontomaxillary facial angle, nasal bone ossification, and tricuspid valve regurgitation, can further improve the detection of chromosomal abnormalities.

# 8. A. Bronchopulmonary sequestration

The most common congenital lung masses are bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), and congenital lobar emphysema. It may be difficult to distinguish these masses prenatally. Bronchopulmonary sequestration is a solid lesion that occurs more commonly in the left lower chest or upper abdomen. As described in this vignette, BPS is typically wedge-shaped with a systemic arterial blood supply.¹ Typically, CPAMs can be either macrocystic (more common) or microcystic and located anywhere in either lung.² Congenital lobar emphysema consists of hyperinflated lung tissue that can appear similar to microcystic congenital pulmonary airway malformations but usually has a predisposition for the upper lobes.³

# 9. C. β₂ glycoprotein 1

There are several plasma proteins, including cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine, prothrombin, annexin 5, and β₂ glycoprotein 1, that can bind to antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of a large number of antibodies to β₂ glycoprotein 1 is strongly associated with the thrombotic findings found in antiphospholipid syndrome.

## 10. A. Chromosomal translocation

During preimplantation genetic testing, cells can be examined by fluorescent in situ hybridization to assess for a chromosomal imbalance. Polymerase chain reaction or targeted gene sequencing can assess for a single gene abnormality. Testing for human compatibility leukocyte antigen and sex selection for an X-linked abnormality is also available.

## 11. B. Chronic TTTS is almost exclusively restricted to twins with monochorionic diamniotic placentation.

More than 80% of monochorionic diamniotic twin gestations have shared vessels within the chorionic villous tree.¹⁻³ These connections can be superficial on the surface of the chorionic plate or unidirectional (ie, arteriovenous) and deep in the placental cotyledons. The deep anastomoses are the largest contributor to the development of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Marginal or velamentous umbilical cord insertions or a single umbilical artery increase the severity of TTTS.⁴

Donor twins are more likely than recipient twins to have a chorionic magistral blood vessel pattern, which is a pattern of large-sized vessels with minimal branching that extend from the site of cord insertion to the periphery of the placenta without significant change in vessel diameter. Donor twins are at greater risk of becoming wrapped in the amnion if there is severe oligohydramnios or anhydramnios and may appear "stuck" to the uterine wall or placenta.

## 12. C. O-negative blood concentrated to a hematocrit between 75% and 80% should be used.

Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling and intrauterine transfusion are typically recommended when the fetal hematocrit is less than 30% with a goal hematocrit between 40% and 50%. O-negative blood concentrated to a hematocrit between 75% and 80% is used to minimize the total blood volume and prevent hydrops caused by cardiac overload. One method to calculate the transfusion volume is to use the following formula:

$$
\text{Transfusion volume} = \frac{\text{hemoglobin (goal)} - \text{hemoglobin (fetal)} \times \text{fetoplacental blood volume}}{\text{hemoglobin (donor)} - \text{hemoglobin (goal)}}
$$

The reference range for fetoplacental blood volume is between 90 and 120 mL/kg.

More commonly, birth centers use the approach described by Giannina et al² that estimates the volume of the transfusion based on the fetal weight.

Administration of prophylactic antibiotics to the pregnant woman prior to percutaneous umbilical blood sampling has not been shown to be beneficial.

A pregnant woman undergoes several physiological changes, including the following:

- Heart rate increases by 10% to 20%.
- Stroke volume increases by 30%.
- Cardiac output increases by 30% to 50%.
- Total blood volume increases by 20% to 50%.
- Systemic vascular resistance decreases by 20%.

Even though their total blood volume increases, pregnant women have relative anemia because the red blood cell volume increases at a lower rate.

## 14. E. Glutathione S-transferase alpha

Women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy have serum bile acid levels that are greater than 12 μmol/L. Affected patients also have increased levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, cholesterol, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, liver transaminases, and glutathione S-transferase alpha. Glutathione S-transferase alpha levels have been shown to correlate with serum bile acid levels.

## 15. C. Preterm delivery is a common outcome in women with preeclampsia; however, in women with late-onset preeclampsia, approximately 25% of the preterm births are thought to be iatrogenic.

A pregnant woman is diagnosed with preeclampsia if she has hypertension that develops after 20 weeks' gestation and proteinuria. Affected women have a higher incidence of having a preterm delivery as a result of maternal or fetal complications. However, in women with late-onset preeclampsia, approximately 25% of the preterm births are thought to be iatrogenic.

Late preterm neonates who are born to women with preeclampsia are at increased risk of being admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit and have a greater risk of respiratory distress syndrome.¹⁻³ Women with preeclampsia have higher levels of the soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (also called sFlt-1); data are conflicting about whether this is associated with an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.²,⁴,⁵

## 16. A. If there is shoulder dystocia resulting in birth injury, the brachial plexus is the most common site of injury.

Neonates born to women with diabetes mellitus who are large for gestational age have an increased risk of shoulder dystocia. This risk correlates with fetal weight—a newborn who weighs more than 4,000 g has a risk of 5% to 7% of shoulder dystocia. Fortunately, most neonates with shoulder dystocia do not have any complications; if a complication does occur, a brachial plexus injury is the most common type of injury, followed by fracture of the clavicle or humerus.¹

While fetuses born to women with diabetes have a normal lean body mass, they have higher fat deposited in their abdominal and shoulder tissues. The greater difference in the chest to head and shoulder to head ratios, which is difficult to predict prenatally, places the neonate at increased risk for shoulder dystocia.

## 17. C. Methadone exposure in utero has been associated with significantly longer duration of treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome than exposure to traditional opiates.

Methadone is one of the most common first-line agents used for adults addicted to opioids. Unfortunately, methadone still has risks when used during pregnancy, including increased risk of preterm delivery, newborns small for gestational age, and neonatal abstinence syndrome, which requires longer medical treatment than exposure to traditional opiates. Buprenorphine is considered a relatively safe option for treating opioid addition during pregnancy, as studies have found that newborns have shorter hospitalizations, lower peak abstinence scores, and lower maximal dose of morphine compared with neonates exposed to methadone in utero.¹

## 18. E. Surfactant deficiency

The woman described in this vignette has findings that are most consistent with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Studies have found that fetuses of affected women also have elevated bile acid levels in cord serum and meconium. Neonates born to women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are at increased risk of surfactant deficiency, bile acid pneumonia, and meconium aspiration syndrome.¹

Newborns born to women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are not at increased risk for cholestasis, rash, hepatitis, or sepsis.

Women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy have lower levels of selenium. Women from Finland and Chile have diets that are low in selenium, which might explain the reason for the higher incidence of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in these populations.

## 20. A. If there are artery-to-vein anastomoses present, they are likely to be deep with both donor-to-recipient and recipient-to-donor communication coexisting, with the net flow favoring donor to recipient.

The pathophysiology of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in monochorionic diamniotic twin gestations is not completely understood. The current explanation is that the shared placenta consists of deep artery-to-vein anastomoses in both directions with a net flow that favors the donor-to-recipient direction. The frequency of artery-to-artery anastomoses is typically lower in pregnancies complicated by TTTS than in non-TTTS pregnancies, suggesting a protective effect.¹,²

A peripheral cord insertion increases the likelihood of TTTS and typically involves the donor twin.¹

Although either twin can develop hydrops if there is TTTS, fetal demise in the donor twin is more common.³

- More likely to be larger than average
- Have findings of decreased perfusion⁴ with increased risk for infarctions

23. A. Humans and apes have the highest levels of plasma progesterone detected at the time of birth.

Progesterone is the primary hormone that establishes and maintains a human pregnancy. While pregnant rodents have increased progesterone levels because of increased ovary production, pregnant primates rely on the placenta to increase progesterone levels. At the time of birth, progesterone levels decrease dramatically in most mammals except for humans and apes, who actually achieve peak progesterone levels at that time. In some animals, the impairment of progesterone receptor function during pregnancy results in delayed delivery beyond term.

24. C. The rate of fetal malformation is 2 to 4 times higher in pregnant women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the general population.

Major fetal malformations in pregnant women with diabetes are most likely if the woman had poor glucose control prior to conception and during the first trimester. $^{1-4}$ The most common types of malformations in this population involve the cardiovascular, neurological, and urinary systems. The rate of fetal malformation is 2 to 4 times higher in pregnant women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the general population. $^{2-6}$ Depending on the study, the fetal malformation rate has been found to be the same or slightly higher in pregnant women with gestational diabetes compared with the general population.

The diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is based on having at least one clinical finding and at least one laboratory finding. The abnormal laboratory findings include the following:

- Elevated serum or plasma immunoglobulin (Ig) M or IgG anticardiolipin antibody titers determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart
- Elevated serum or plasma IgM or IgG anti- $\beta_{2}$ glycoprotein antibody titers determined by ELISA on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart
- Increased plasma lupus anticoagulant test on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart

If all 3 antibodies are elevated, the pregnant patient is at greater risk of thromboses and pregnancy-related morbidities. $^{2}$

## 26. B. Chronic hypertension

Chronic hypertension is the maternal risk factor with the highest likelihood ratio (LR) for the development of preeclampsia (LR = 12.5).¹ The second highest LR is antiphospholipid syndrome (LR = 9.7), followed by prior history of preeclampsia (LR = 7), diabetes (LR = 3.5), twin gestation (LR = 3), nulliparity (LR = 3), and obesity (LR = 2.5).¹ Maternal black race is associated with a LR of 1.5. Additional detection methods, however, are needed, as these maternal risk factors only identify about 30% of women who develop preeclampsia.²

## 27. A. Absence of the echolucent clear space between the uterus and placenta is an ultrasonographic finding that suggests the presence of placenta accreta.

Placenta accreta, placenta increta, and placenta percreta are abnormal forms of placentation in which the chorionic villi of the placenta attach abnormally to the uterus. Although an abnormal placentation is a clinical diagnosis, there are several ultrasonographic findings that are suggestive of an abnormal placentation, including¹,²

- Absence of the echolucent clear space between the uterus and placenta
- Thin hyperechoic space between the serosa of the uterus and the maternal bladder wall
- Appearance of placental lacunae with or without high-velocity flow
- Abnormal color Doppler flow at the interface between the myometrium and the maternal bladder

Magnetic resonance imaging has similar sensitivity compared with ultrasonography in the diagnosis of abnormal placentation, but it may be useful for distinguishing placenta accreta, the least invasive form, from placenta percreta, the most invasive form.³

Maternal corticosteroid administration has no effect on placenta implantation.

## 28. B. As adults, children born preterm and at low birth weights are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

In the United States, the rate of preterm birth increased by more than 20% between 1990 and 2006. Since then, there has been a steady decline in preterm birth that is attributable to a decrease in elective deliveries prior to 39 weeks' gestation.¹ Children who are born preterm and at low birth weights are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life.²

## 29. A. Echocardiographic evidence of cardiomyopathy

There are several factors that determine the chance of survival in twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), including the following:

- Gestational age at onset
- Degree of progression
- Cardiac function of recipient twin

---

<!-- Page 502 -->

Answers

- Timing of prenatal intervention
- Birth gestational age

Regardless of the type of procedure that is performed to treat TTTS, echocardiographic evidence of cardiomyopathy is the greatest risk factor for intrauterine demise of the recipient twin.

30. E. Unlike in normal pregnancies, women who go on to have preeclampsia are noted to have an incomplete remodeling of the spiral arteries in the placenta.

Although the precise pathogenesis of preeclampsia is still unknown, the disease process requires the following 2 features:

- Early disruption in the remodeling of the spiral arteries within the placenta, with an increase in stiffness of these vessels¹
- A systemic antiangiogenic response in the pregnant woman

While the vascular disruption is thought to occur early in gestation, the maternal clinical manifestations of preeclampsia are not observed until after 20 weeks' gestation. The late clinical findings are thought to result, in part, from increased microparticles that are released from the syncytiotrophoblast into the maternal circulation as the pregnancy progresses.²,³ Pregnant women with preeclampsia also have higher amounts of antiangiogenic factors, such as the soluble membrane receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor called Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 or sFLT-1,⁴,⁵ that probably contributes to the maternal clinical findings.

34. E. The main concern is that dilation of the aortic root could lead to dissection and aortic rupture. If a pregnant woman has Marfan syndrome, there is a 50% chance of the neonate being affected because Marfan syndrome has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. During pregnancy, women are at risk of aortic dissection or rupture if there is significant dilation of the aortic root. If a woman's aortic root is dilated greater than 4.5 cm prior to pregnancy, aortic repair is recommended.

35. D. Multiple gestations

The greatest risk to the fetus conceived by assisted reproductive technology is the increased risk of multiple gestations, which constitute 35% to 41% of these pregnancies, with the frequency of twin gestation being 24% to 29% in the United States, Europe and Canada.¹,² Multiple gestation leads to an increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and slower postnatal growth during the first 3 years after birth.

36. C. Deep venous thrombosis

Antiphospholipid syndrome in nonpregnant human adults leads to venous thromboses such as

- Superficial thrombosis
- Deep venous thrombosis
- Pulmonary embolism
- Mesenteric, portal, intracranial, and retinal thrombosis

Affected patients can also have arterial thromboses such as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or renal and adrenal artery thrombosis. Less commonly, multiple microvascular thromboses can occur, potentially leading to cardiopulmonary failure.

Non-thrombotic complications of APS include cardiac valvular disease, hemolytic anemia, livedo reticularis, and thrombocytopenia.

The fetal magnetic resonance imaging described in this vignette is most consistent with a left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The location of the fetal liver has been shown to be predictive of postnatal survival.¹-³ Albanese et al found that an intra-abdominal location of the fetal liver was associated with 93% survival and 19% need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) compared with an intra-thoracic liver location that was associated with 43% survival and 53% need for ECMO.⁴

## 38. C. An imbalance in angiogenic factors, with increased levels of antiangiogenic factors such as soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1

A shallow cytotrophoblast invasion is the first stage in the development of preeclampsia in pregnant women. This leads to a high placental vascular resistance and placental hypoperfusion resulting in an imbalance in both angiogenic factors and antiangiogenic factors, which favors the antiangiogenic state. $^{1,2}$ While the antiangiogenic factors Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 and soluble endoglin are increased, the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor are decreased. $^{3,4}$

43. E. Progesterone leads to quiescence of the uterine myometrium, partly by downregulating gap junctions.

Pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery may benefit from treatment with progesterone. This effect is thought to be mediated by the role of progesterone in¹,²

- Assisting with quiescence of the uterine myometrium by downregulating gap junctions
- Decreasing oxytocin receptors
- Increasing the stimulation threshold of contractions
- Inhibiting cervical ripening

The role of progesterone in maintaining pregnancy has been supported by animal data that showed a decrease in plasma progesterone levels prior to the onset of labor.²,³ In addition, studies in humans have shown that progesterone-blocking agents can induce labor,⁴,⁵ suggesting that preterm labor might be partly attributable to an abnormal decrease in progesterone.

46. C. Lacunae or small spaces first form within the syncytial layer and then expand and join to form a lacunar network that later develops into the intervillous space within the placenta.

During a normal pregnancy, the blastocyst implants into the endometrium and then differentiates into 2 layers, the outer syncytiotrophoblast layer and the inner cytotrophoblast layer. Between 8 to 13 days post-coitus, small spaces called lacunae form within the syncytiotrophoblast layer that expand and form a lacunar network. This lacunar system later develops into the intervillous space within the placenta that contains maternal blood. Cytotrophoblast cells invade the syncytial columns that remain after the lacunae develop and become the placental villi that contain fetal vessels.

47. C. If a pregnant woman does have a change in the vaginal microbial community, it usually is from one type of Lactobacillus-dominant community to another.

48. C. Stromal histiocytes, called Hofbauer cells, are found in placental villi.

With advancing gestation, the placental villous network becomes more elaborate. The larger primary villi contain muscular arteries with thick walls that branch into secondary and tertiary villi with a greater number of small vessels. While stromal histiocytes, also known as Hofbauer cells, are found in placental villi of a normal placenta, lymphocytes and plasma cells are abnormal findings suggesting chronic inflammation. The space between the villi contains maternal blood that flows freely around the villi, allowing for exchange of gas and nutrients with the intravillous vessels.

49. C. Stage III

In 1999, Quintero et al described an ultrasonographic staging system to predict the hemodynamic effect on the fetuses with twin-twin transfusion syndrome.¹ There are 5 stages with increasing severity.

- Stage I: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios, visible donor bladder
- Stage II: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios, donor bladder not visible
- Stage III: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios, abnormal umbilical Doppler flow (donor with absent or reversed end-diastolic flow in umbilical arteries, recipient with pulsatile flow in umbilical vein, and/or recipient with reversal of flow in the ductus venosus)
- Stage IV: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios and hydrops in either the donor or recipient
- Stage V: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios and demise (impending or actual) in one or both twins The ultrasonographic findings described in this vignette are most consistent with stage III.

# 51. B. For nearly all women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin is necessary in pregnancy, often with increased dosage requirements.

Insulin is required for all pregnant women with type 1 diabetes mellitus and for almost all women with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In contrast with nonpregnant women with diabetes, it is recommended that pregnant women with diabetes check their blood glucose 4 times a day for maximal glucose control. This maintenance of glucose control is critical, as poor control preconception and during the first trimester increases the risk of congenital anomalies and poor control later in pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal morbidities. Fetal echocardiography should be obtained in all women with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus at approximately 22 weeks' gestation because of the increased risk of structural heart disease.

# 52. D. Is more likely to have thrombocytopenia that usually resolves by 10 days of age

Neonates born to women with preeclampsia are more likely to have transient thrombocytopenia after birth that typically resolves by 10 days of age. In most cases, the thrombocytopenia is not severe and is more common in neonates who also are growth-restricted.¹ The pathophysiology of the thrombocytopenia is probably attributable to several factors, such as decreased platelet production following fetal hypoxia, platelet sequestration in small vessels, and platelet destruction within the placenta.²,³ Transient neutropenia is also a common hematologic abnormality in neonates born to women with preeclampsia, particularly in neonates with growth restriction.

During the transition to extrauterine life, fluid within the airways moves to the adjacent perialveolar tissue. $^{1}$ Complete liquid clearance can take several hours. $^{1,2}$ During this time, the lung is filled with an excessive amount of fetal lung liquid, which is associated with increased pressures within the pulmonary interstitium $^{2}$ and greater tissue expansion of the chest wall. $^{3}$

58. D. Increased observation, either as inpatient or outpatient

The management of pregnant women with preeclampsia focuses on decreasing maternal and neonatal morbidity by achieving control of blood pressures, preventing seizures, and determining the ideal timing of delivery. If a woman has preeclampsia without severe features, the obstetrician will monitor the woman's blood pressure more closely, along with regular assessment of laboratory data, fetal growth, and amniotic fluid volume. This can be done with the patient as an outpatient or inpatient. Typically, medical management is not required. Delivery is recommended at 37 weeks' gestation if there are no other concerns. $^{1}$

This reduction in coactivators likely impairs activity of the progesterone receptors and promotes labor. $^{1}$ Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated RNA splicing factors, which are progesterone receptor corepressors, decrease in the myometrium during late gestation. $^{2,3}$

## 60. A. Angiogenic factors

The precise pathophysiology of preeclampsia is unknown but is thought to consist of poor placentation with a decreased uteroplacental blood supply. The subsequent placental hypoxia leads to a release of inflammatory, oxidative stress and antiangiogenic mediators, resulting in a systemic inflammatory response with clinical manifestations later in pregnancy.¹ Studies have found high concentrations of antiangiogenic factors (eg, soluble endoglin, soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 or sFlt-1) and lower concentrations of angiogenic factors (eg, placental growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor) during the second trimester of pregnant women who later develop preeclampsia.²,³ Quantification of these compounds holds promise for the early diagnosis of preeclampsia prior to the development of symptoms to allow for earlier medical interventions.

## 61. D. The primary cause of fetal overgrowth in pregnancies in women with diabetes is fetal hyperinsulinemia.

The most common fetal complication in pregnant women with diabetes is fetal overgrowth occurring in the last trimester. The term large for gestational age is defined as a neonate with a birth weight above the 90th percentile, but a stricter definition has also been used (&gt;97.7th percentile above the mean birth weight). If a neonate's birth weight is greater than 4,000 g, the term macrosomia is used, although large for gestational age and macrosomia are often used interchangeably. The excessive fetal growth associated with maternal diabetes is attributable to fetal hyperinsulinemia in response to intrauterine hyperglycemia.¹,² Although affected neonates have greater amounts of adipose tissue and organomegaly, their head size is typically appropriate for age.

Predicting the birth weight in fetuses of women with diabetes is important, as neonates with high birth weights have an increased risk for birth-related injuries. However, the ability of ultrasonography to predict birth weights greater than 4,000 g is lower than the predictability for typical birth weights.³

## 62. B. Persistent APS-associated antibodies may be associated with a risk of autism spectrum and developmental disorders.

Data have shown that neonates born to women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) have a greater risk of preterm birth (16%) and being born small for gestational age (11%). The lupus anticoagulant was detectable in 4% of neonates born to mothers with APS compared with anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-β₂ glycoprotein antibodies, which were detectable in 16% and 18% of neonates, respectively; these antibodies persisted during the first 6 months after birth.³ Follow-up studies have found an increased risk of neurodevelopmental issues, such as autism spectrum and developmental disorders.⁴ Although neonatal thromboses can occur, most affected neonates also have another risk factor for thromboses, such as a central line catheter, sepsis, or perinatal depression.⁵

63. B. Due to the potential for maternal hemorrhage in a delivery with placenta accreta, a planned cesarean delivery and hysterectomy is typically required.

Pregnancies complicated by placenta accreta, increta, or percreta are at high risk for partial placental separation at the time of delivery with associated risk of severe maternal hemorrhage. As a result, a planned hysterectomy after delivery is usually recommended.¹² To avoid the risk of maternal hemorrhage with advancing gestational age, most women with this diagnosis are delivered between 34 and 35 weeks' gestation.³⁴ Neonatal morbidity is not affected by the type of placental invasion.⁵

64. B. As early as 1990, a meta-analysis by Keirse showed a beneficial effect of 17-hydroxyprogesterone on reducing preterm birth with a pooled odds ratio of 0.50.

Initial studies examining the potential of progesterone administration to prevent preterm birth in pregnant women were conflicting. One meta-analysis published by Keirse in 1990 showed a positive benefit.¹ The author found that 17-hydroxyprogesterone led to a reduction in preterm birth with a pooled odds ratio of 0.5 (CI 0.3-0.85) in pregnant women with a prior preterm birth.¹ In contrast, intramuscular 17-OH progesterone administration had no effect on preterm birth rate in a randomized controlled trial of 168 active women in the military.²

In 2003, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network reported evidence for the use of progesterone based on results from a randomized controlled trial of 310 women.³ The authors found that women who received weekly intramuscular 17-OH progesterone starting between 16 and 20 weeks' gestation until 36 weeks' gestation had a reduction in the risk of delivery at

- Less than 37 weeks' gestation (decrease from 54.9% to 36.3%, relative risk 0.66, CI 0.54-0.81)
- Less than 35 weeks' gestation (decrease from 30.7% to 20.6%, relative risk 0.67, CI 0.48-0.93)
- Less than 32 weeks' gestation (decrease from 19.6% to 11.4%, relative risk 0.58, CI 0.37-0.91)³

65. A. A model of reduced uterine perfusion pressure has been studied in rats as well as other animals; reduced uterine perfusion pressure has been found to cause proteinuria, hypertension, impaired renal function, and fetal growth restriction, although reduced trophoblast invasion does not occur.

Researchers have had difficulty finding an animal model that mimics all the manifestations of preeclampsia in humans. Although models in nonhuman primates are most similar to preeclampsia in humans, mice and rat models are more commonly used because of increased availability and lower cost. A pregnant rat model of reduced uterine perfusion pressure following surgical narrowing of the aorta causes proteinuria, hypertension, impaired renal function, and fetal growth restriction, but reduced trophoblast invasion does not occur.¹⁻³ Models of overexpression of antiangiogenic factors in pregnant rats⁴ and mice⁵ have also led to hypertension, proteinuria, and renal injury, although progression to eclampsia does not occur.

Immune models for preeclampsia are based on the observation that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 are markedly decreased in women with preeclampsia. Pregnant baboons that received monoclonal antibodies directed at IL-10 had abnormal trophoblast invasion with elevated maternal mean blood pressures but did not exhibit proteinuria, abnormal liver enzyme levels, or thrombocytopenia.⁶ One model of placental maldevelopment involved administration of doxycycline to pregnant rats that led to a decrease in trophoblast invasion and lighter placental mass.⁷

## 66. E. Pruritus

The most common initial clinical manifestation of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is pruritus. The itching typically involves the palmar and plantar areas but can also be more extensive. The other potential manifestations listed are not typically found in this disease.

## 67. E. The preterm gastrointestinal tract tends to have abnormal bacterial colonization with less diversification and a greater number of pathogenic bacteria.

Research shows that many placentas of healthy pregnant women are colonized with bacteria. This knowledge has implications for intrauterine colonization of the fetus. Indeed, sequencing techniques suggest that amniotic fluid is also colonized with microbes that could play a role in the development of the gut microbiome. A recent study analyzed the microbiota in the meconium of neonates within 48 hours after birth and found that the organisms were more similar to amniotic fluid flora compared with the microbes in the oral and vaginal cavities.¹

The type and number of placental microbes, as well as the effect on amniotic fluid bacteria, might play a role in preterm births by inciting a fetoplacental inflammatory response. Contrary to normal fetal gut development where the interaction between toll-like receptors and commensal bacteria downregulates inflammation, the preterm neonate is likely to have a gastrointestinal tract with increased immunoreactivity.² The preterm gastrointestinal tract tends to have abnormal bacterial colonization with less diversification³ and a greater number of pathogenic bacteria.⁴ This might have implications later in life, as one study found that a low intestinal microbial diversity at age 1 month was associated with immunoglobulin E-associated eczema later in life.⁵

## 68. D. Placentas from women with pregestational type 1 diabetes mellitus are different from women with GDM, tending to have immature chorionic villi and a relatively increased proliferation index with more villose necrosis.

The placentas of women with pregestational diabetes have distinct placental findings compared with those of women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Specifically, pregestational placentas tend to have immature chorionic villi with an increased proliferation index and greater villose necrosis.¹⁻⁴

## 69. D. Facilitated diffusion

While gases are transferred across the placenta by simple diffusion, glucose is transferred by facilitated diffusion with the assistance of GLUT3 and GLUT1 hexose transporters. Active transport allows for the transfer of amino acids from maternal to fetal circulation, which is against the concentration gradient. Water is transferred across the placenta by bulk flow, while immunoglobulins move across the placenta by endocytosis/exocytosis.

## 70. C. Infiltration of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and sometimes plasma cells into placental villi, often leading to villose agglutination

In addition to the infiltration of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and sometimes plasma cells into placental villi, chronic villositis is typically multifocal and is often found in TORCH syndrome.

## 71. E. Photocoagulate the placental anastomoses using laser energy to interrupt the placental hemodynamic imbalance.

The gold-standard approach to progressive or severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome is to perform the fetoscopic laser occlusion of chorioangiopagous placental vessels (FLOC) procedure. This technique consists of photocoagulation of the placental anastomoses using laser energy to disrupt the placental hemodynamic imbalance.[1,2] Essentially, this procedure converts the placenta from a monochorionic to dichorionic type, although some connections are likely still present.[3,4] FLOC has been shown to be more effective than serial amnioreduction with higher survival rates and lower morbidities.[1]

## 72. E. The most common complication encountered during fetal blood sampling and transfusion is fetal bradycardia, which is reported to occur in 7% to 52% of procedures but is usually self-limited.

Depending on the report, the risk of fetal bradycardia can vary between 7% to 52% post-periumbilical blood sampling procedure. Fortunately, the bradycardia resolves spontaneously in most cases and is profound in only 3% to 4% of cases. If bleeding does occur, it is usually mild and resolves after Wharton jelly covers the incision site. Premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and preterm labor occur infrequently (between 0.1% and 0.7%).

## 73. C. May decrease the risk of placental abruption

Magnesium sulfate administration to pregnant women during labor has been shown to decrease the risk of eclampsia by 58% and reduce the risk of placental abruption (relative risk 0.67, CI 0.45-0.89). However, it does not alter maternal morbidity or rate of cesarean delivery. For women with preeclampsia with severe features, magnesium sulfate is also recommended in the immediate postpartum period. Studies show that administration of magnesium sulfate to pregnant women does not affect neonatal morbidities.

## 75. A. Congenital heart disease such as ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, and atrial septal defect

Monochorionic diamniotic twins can have ischemic-related injuries associated with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). These include the following:

- Brain injuries such as white matter infarction, intraventricular hemorrhage, and porencephaly¹,²
- Renal injuries such as renal cortical necrosis
- Intestinal atresia
- Cutis aplasia
- Limb necrosis

All monochorionic diamniotic twins are at increased risk for structural heart disease, such as ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, and atrial septal defect. Studies have found a 7% risk of congenital heart disease in monochorionic diamniotic twins³ compared with the baseline risk of 0.5% in healthy singleton pregnancies.⁴ If TTTS is also present, the risk of structural heart disease is even higher.⁴ The pathogenesis of the overall increased risk of heart disease in monochorionic diamniotic twins is poorly understood but probably relates to fluctuations in flow to the fetuses, alterations in angiogenic factors, unequal placental sharing, and inherent genetic factors.

## 76. C. Fetal energy demands for tissue growth are greatest during the third trimester in humans, including fat deposition.

Fetal energy demands for tissue growth and fat deposition are highest during the last trimester in human pregnancies. One theory of parturition is that it begins when fetal metabolic needs exceed the maternal supply. In support of this theory, population studies in the Netherlands have shown that in times of famine, when maternal supply is low, there was a consistent and significant reduction in the average gestational length by 4 days.¹

After birth, the human newborn weighs 50% more than the predicted neonate to mother ratio.² Primates other than humans are almost fully developed at term gestation, accounting for the large head size compared to the body; this contrasts with the human brain that is initially relatively small but continues to grow rapidly after delivery.³

77. C. Cesarean delivery is probably indicated when the estimated fetal weight is greater than 4,500 g or if there is arrest of descent of the head or a prolonged second stage of labor.

The 2017 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on fetal macrosomia recommends that

- "With an estimated fetal weight of greater than 4,500 g, a prolonged second stage of labor or arrest of descent in the second stage is an indication for cesarean delivery."
- "Barring unusual circumstances, cesarean delivery should be performed for midpelvic arrest of the fetus with suspected macrosomia."

Neonates with macrosomia who are born to women who have diabetes have a greater risk of shoulder dystocia if they are born by vaginal delivery with vacuum extraction or forceps assist. Although neonates of mothers who have diabetes are at risk for respiratory distress syndrome, current guidelines do not suggest prenatal steroids for term births.

78. A. Neonates with perinatal thrombosis associated with APS often have other risk factors for thrombosis, such as a central vascular catheter or an inherited thrombophilia.

Antiphospholipid antibodies in pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) can cross the placenta into the fetus. Neonates who were exposed to these antibodies are at increased risk for large thromboses if they have another thrombotic risk factor, such as a central vascular catheter, sepsis, preterm birth, perinatal depression, or an inherited thrombophilia.¹² There have been case reports of neonates with symptoms of APS with the presence of serum antiphospholipid antibodies but without cord antiphospholipid antibodies, suggesting that de novo primary APS can occur.³

81. D. There have been at least 2 randomized controlled trials showing that vaginal progesterone is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of preterm delivery in women with shortened cervix. After studies found that progesterone decreased the risk of preterm delivery in women with a prior preterm birth, researchers then examined the effect of progesterone on women with a shortened transvaginal cervical length, as this is a strong risk factor for preterm birth. In 2005, 250 women with a shortened cervix were randomized to receive vaginal progesterone or placebo starting at 20 to 25 weeks' gestation until delivery or 34 weeks' gestation.¹ The group who received progesterone had a significantly lower rate of preterm birth (19% vs 34%; relative risk, 0.56; 95% CI 0.36–0.86), even without a prior history of preterm delivery.¹ In 2011, another trial randomized 458 women with a shortened cervix to receive vaginal progesterone or placebo between 20 and 24 weeks' gestation until delivery or 37 weeks' gestation and found a similar reduction in preterm birth, independent of prior history of preterm delivery.² Both of these studies were double-blinded.

Human embryonic stem cells can be used to generate trophoblast using 3 models.

- Generating trophoblast cell lines by disaggregating and culturing embryonic stem cells without substances that maintain their pluripotency.¹ Trophoblast cells form on the outer layer, which is similar to their location in the placenta.
- Knocking down genes in human and mouse embryonic stem cells that are important for maintaining pluripotency; this approach causes these stem cells to differentiate into trophoblasts.²
- Treating human embryonic stem cells with transforming growth factor beta, such as BMP4 or BMP10, causing them to differentiate into trophoblast cells.³,⁴

Answers

The most common pregnancy-specific complication of APS is preeclampsia, occurring in as many as 50% of affected pregnancies. Approximately one-third of pregnancies affected by APS are associated with preterm birth, and approximately 20% lead to intrauterine growth restriction. Affected women often have a history of recurrent first-trimester pregnancy loss, with second and third trimester fetal demise also occurring.

85. B. Both donor and recipient twins are at risk for hypertension and should have blood pressures monitored closely.

In pregnancies complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), donor twins are more likely to have growth restrictions with anemia and recipient twins are more likely to be large for gestational age with polycythemia. In the immediate newborn period, both neonates should be assessed for cardiovascular strain. Approximately 62% of affected twins are also at higher risk for hypertension at age 2 years as a result of intrauterine cardiovascular and renal adaptations to TTTS. Donor twins are also at increased risk for renal tubular apoptosis.

87. E. Up to 50% of women with gestational diabetes mellitus will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life.

Pregnant women have decreased insulin sensitivity in the liver and peripheral tissues with advancing gestational age; correspondingly, insulin secretion increases to maintain euglycemia. Gestational diabetes mellitus develops if the increase in insulin secretion is inadequate, resulting in hyperglycemia. Gestational diabetes occurs in approximately 4% to 6% of all pregnancies.[1,2] The prevalence of gestational diabetes has been increasing over the past 20 years because the incidence of obesity has increased and detection methods have improved.[3] Most women with gestational diabetes are diagnosed at the time of routine glucose screening, which occurs between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation. Up to 50% of women with gestational diabetes mellitus will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life.[4,5]

As noted in the answer, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided during pregnancy because of teratogenic effects in the first trimester, and increased risk of retinopathy, hypotension, and renal dysfunction, when exposure occurs in the second and third trimesters.

It is safe to administer adenosine during pregnancy and prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis for pregnant women with cardiac lesions. Because unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin do not cross the placenta, they are safe to prescribe during pregnancy. However, warfarin does cross the placenta and is not recommended for anticoagulation during pregnancy.

89. C. Prenatal and postnatal prophylaxis with anti-D antibody are highly effective in preventing sensitization and subsequent hemolysis and hydrops.

If a fetus has Rh-group antigens C, c, D, E, e, or Kell and the pregnant woman is negative for these antigens, the pregnant woman can produce antibodies (usually immunoglobulin G) that cross the placenta to bind to and destroy fetal red blood cells. Rh-D-specific immunoglobulin prophylaxis with anti-D antibody (eg, RhoGAM) is now given to all pregnant women with Rh-negative blood type (independent of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity and ultrasonographic findings).¹ This has significantly decreased the risk of Rh alloimmunization. However, a pregnant woman with Rh-negative blood type is still at risk for hemolysis in the fetus and newborn if anti-D antibodies are missed or if maternal antibodies are produced against other paternal antigens.

Growth-restricted neonates born to women with preeclampsia are at increased risk for feeding intolerance if they have absent end-diastolic flow by prenatal umbilical artery Doppler studies.¹ Data are inconsistent about whether preterm neonates born to women with preeclampsia have an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.²⁻⁴

Neonates born to mothers with preeclampsia are also at increased risk for transient neutropenia, polycythemia, and thrombocytopenia. It is uncertain whether affected neonates are at greater risk for sepsis.

92. B. Estrogen and progesterone affect T-cell switching toward the Th2 phenotype.

Estrogen and progesterone influence the switch of T cells from the Th1 to the Th2 state.¹ As a result, pregnant women have a lower sensitivity to Th1-mediated antiviral infections and increased sensitivity to Th2-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. It is thought that pregnant women who have obesity make this transition from Th1 to Th2 earlier than pregnant women who do not have obesity.²

# 94. C. In African Americans, an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IL-6 receptor gene and preterm birth has been described.

The process of parturition is extremely complex and involves genetic influences of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. As preterm birth has been associated with inflammation, researchers have focused on the inflammatory pathway to identify candidate parturition genes. Preterm labor is more common in African Americans compared with European Americans, and it is possible that this is related to having more single nucleotide polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, TNF receptor 1, TNF receptor 2, and interleukin 6 receptor genes that have been found in African Americans. $^{1,2}$

# 95. A. Catastrophic APS is a subset of APS in which neonates with antiphospholipid antibodies have a rapid presentation of thrombosis, arterial occlusion, or microthrombi in 3 or more organs.

Neonates born to women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are exposed to antiphospholipid antibodies during gestation. However, these antibodies are insufficient to lead to neonatal disease; instead, large vessel thrombosis is found in neonates born to women with APS if the neonate has another prothrombotic risk factor (eg, central vascular catheter, sepsis, perinatal depression, prematurity, inherited prothrombotic genetic disorder). $^{1,2}$

Catastrophic APS occurs in a subgroup of patients with APS. In this type, neonates with antiphospholipid antibodies have a rapid presentation of thrombosis, arterial occlusion, or microthrombi in 3 or more organs. $^{3}$  Further studies are needed to explain why some neonates develop this form of APS.

Women with placenta accreta, increta, and percreta are at high risk for hemorrhage at the time of delivery because of the risk of partial placental separation. As a result, a multidisciplinary team needs to be present at the time of a planned cesarean delivery.

# 101. C. Delivery is recommended between 34% and 36% weeks' gestation if the woman has poor in-hospital glycemic control.

Pregnant women with well-controlled pregestational or gestational diabetes mellitus should be managed expectantly until 39 weeks' gestation. In women with poorly controlled diabetes, delivery is recommended between 34% and 36% weeks' gestation if the woman has poor in-hospital glycemic control or fetal testing results are abnormal. If delivery prior to 37 weeks' gestation is anticipated, women with gestational diabetes mellitus should be given corticosteroids to decrease the risk of respiratory distress syndrome; the administration of corticosteroids to women with pregestational diabetes mellitus is less clear and the current recommendation is to provide corticosteroids if the delivery is expected to be before 34 weeks' gestation.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) defines macrosomia as an estimated fetal weight exceeding 4,500 g in neonates born to women who have a diagnosis of pregestational or gestational diabetes mellitus. Studies show that induction of labor for pregnant women with diabetes with macrosomic fetuses does not decrease the risk of birth trauma. The most recent ACOG Practice Bulletin about the delivery approach for fetal macrosomia states that

- "With an estimated fetal weight of greater than 4,500 g, a prolonged second stage of labor or arrest of descent in the second stage is an indication for cesarean delivery."
- "Barring unusual circumstances, cesarean delivery should be performed for midpelvic arrest of the fetus with suspected macrosomia."

# 102. A. There are higher rates of subnormal growth at 12 and 18 months' corrected age with significantly lower head circumference percentiles at 18 months' corrected age.

There have only been a few studies examining the growth outcomes in infants born to women with preeclampsia. One cohort study compared infant growth in very low-birth-weight infants born to normotensive women (n=46) and women with preeclampsia (n=40). Data showed that infants born to women with preeclampsia had greater rates of poor growth at 12 and 18 months' corrected age with significantly lower head circumference percentiles at 18 months' corrected age. Data about long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in this population are inconsistent.

Studies have not found that infants born to women with preeclampsia are at increased risk for severe intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia, with some data suggesting a possible lower risk.[2,3]

Term infants born to women with preeclampsia might be at higher risk for encephalopathy, which is possibly attributable to a greater fetal inflammatory response in these infants.

## 104. C. Placental blood flow is significantly reduced in pregnant women who use tobacco.

Among pregnant women, the most common licit substance of abuse is tobacco, which has been shown to significantly decrease placental blood flow. Alcohol is the most common teratogenic substance of abuse and can also lead to preterm birth and low birth weight. Because of these potential adverse outcomes, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women should not drink any amount of alcohol during pregnancy. Amphetamine use during pregnancy is also associated with preterm birth and low birth weight. Use of tobacco, alcohol, and amphetamines during pregnancy can change maternal physiology and also have a direct effect on the uterus, placenta, and fetal brain.

## 105. D. Symptoms typically occur in the first week postpartum.

Psychosis occurs in approximately 1 to 3 per 1,000 postpartum women. It typically manifests during the first week after delivery and usually requires emergency hospitalization because it evolves rapidly. Women with postpartum psychosis can have delusions, mood swings ranging from euphoria to depression, hallucinations, insomnia, and/or confusion. Limited data suggest that prophylactic treatment in women at high risk can prevent this disorder, but further studies are warranted.

## 106. B. In the 2013 executive summary from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, one part of the definition for preeclampsia is that the systolic blood pressure be equal to or greater than $140\mathrm{mmHg}$ at 2 distinct times at least 4 hours apart.

In 2013, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defined preeclampsia as new-onset hypertension after 20 completed weeks' gestation with a systolic blood pressure equal to or greater than $140\mathrm{mmHg}$ and/or a diastolic pressure equal to or greater than $90\mathrm{mmHg}$ measured on 2 distinct occasions at least 4 hours apart. To be given this diagnosis, patients also need to have proteinuria, which was defined as equal to or greater than $300\mathrm{mg}/24$ hours or a protein-creatinine ratio equal to or greater than $0.3\mathrm{mg/dL}$. A diagnosis of intrauterine growth restriction is not a criterion for the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Most cases of preeclampsia are diagnosed after 20 weeks' gestation.

Preeclampsia with severe features requires a systolic blood pressure equal to or greater than $160\mathrm{mmHg}$ or diastolic pressure greater than $110\mathrm{mmHg}$ measured on 2 distinct occasions at least 4 hours apart or other clinical findings such as thrombocytopenia, persistent abdominal pain, liver or renal dysfunction, pulmonary edema, cerebral disturbances, or visual changes.

## 107. D. Postnatal depression

The most likely benefit of marine oil supplementation during pregnancy may be the prevention of maternal postnatal depression. Using published prevalence data from 23 countries, Hibbeln found that lower amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in human milk and lower seafood consumption during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression.¹ Studies are ongoing to assess whether long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy can decrease the risk of postpartum depression.

## 108. C. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection

There is a higher incidence of genomic imprinting disorders, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Angelman syndrome, in neonates who were conceived by assisted reproductive technology.¹ This is thought to be due to changes in pH and serum concentrations in the in vitro cultures and manipulation of in vitro cultured embryos. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is the most common assisted reproductive technology associated with genomic imprinting disorders.

## 110. A. Exceptionally large placentas are associated with adverse outcomes.

Women who have obesity tend to have placentas that are larger than average for gestational age. Neonates with placentas that are extremely large or neonates that are large relative to their placentas have a greater risk of adverse outcomes.¹ Placental efficiency is the ratio of fetal to placental weight, and this varies during gestation.² A decrease in placental efficiency is associated with an increased risk for adult-onset cardiovascular disease.³

## 112. A. Barker

David Barker and colleagues were the first to report that poor nutrition during fetal life and early infancy was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease during adulthood. This was based on data examining outcomes of neonates born in Hertfordshire between 1911 and 1930; the authors found that lower birth weights and lower weight at 1 year of age were independently associated with an increased mortality rate as a result of adult cardiovascular disease.¹²

## 113. B. Chronic chorioamnionitis

The patient described in this vignette has a diagnosis that is most likely consistent with chronic chorioamnionitis. In this disease, there is a patchy infiltration of lymphocytes in the chorion on the fetal side. It is often accompanied by chronic villositis and chronic deciduitis. Some cases may be attributable to an infection.

## 114. B. Major malformations occur in 6% to 12% of neonates born to women with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, with the initial injury occurring by the seventh week of gestation.

Major congenital malformations are the main cause of perinatal mortality in women with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.¹ They occur in 6% to 12% of these pregnancies with the initial injury occurring by the seventh week of gestation.¹ Structural heart disease is the most common malformation with a 5-fold increase in ventricular septal defects and transposition of the great arteries. Abnormalities of the central nervous system and skeletal system are the next most common malformations. In contrast to neonates born to women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, neonates born to women with gestational diabetes are not at increased risk for major malformations, as the onset of maternal disease occurs after the period of organogenesis.²

## 115. D. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports the statement that “moderate caffeine consumption (less than 200 mg per day) does not appear to be a major contributing factor in miscarriage or preterm birth.”

Caffeine is a common licit substance ingested by pregnant woman. It is able to cross the placenta and although some studies suggest a possible risk of decreased fetal growth with moderate to high caffeine intake (&gt;150 mg/d), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) is uncertain about this association.¹² ACOG supports the statement that “moderate caffeine consumption (less than 200 mg per day) does not appear to be a major contributing factor in miscarriage or preterm birth.”³ Caffeine has not been associated with later development of childhood leukemia or other cancers in infancy.

Ursodeoxycholic acid is the most effective treatment to lower bile acid concentrations in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.¹ This medication relieves pruritus by increasing the excretion of hydrophobic bile acids and hepatotoxic compounds. Women can also take antihistamines to decrease pruritus symptoms and assist with sleeping.

## 118. C. Dehydroepiandrosterone

The human placenta plays a variety of roles in the production and transfer of hormones. There are 3 general categories of hormones involved during gestation.

- Hormones that are produced by the pregnant woman that act on the placenta and can be transferred to the fetus (eg, thyroid hormone, oxytocin, estrogen)
- Hormones that are produced by the fetus, altered by the placenta, and then transferred to the fetus or the pregnant woman (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone)
- Hormones that are produced by the placenta and transferred to the pregnant woman and/or fetus (eg, insulinlike growth factor type 2, which is transferred to the fetus, and human chorionic gonadotropin, which is transferred to the pregnant woman)

## 119. E. Primary causes of maternal mortality during pregnancy include cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, aortic dissection, and myocardial infarction.

An atrial septal defect is one of the most common cardiac defects found in pregnant women. If a woman has a coarctation of the aorta, the Valsalva maneuver should be discouraged during the second stage of labor. Because most pregnant women with a history of tetralogy of Fallot or a patent ductus arteriosus have already had a complete repair of their lesion, the pregnancy is well-tolerated.

Although the incidence of cardiac disease in pregnancy women is low (approximately 4%), morbidity is as high as 34%. The most common causes of mortality in pregnant women are cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, aortic dissection, and myocardial infarction.

## 120. C. Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling and platelet transfusion may be of benefit in this fetus if the fetus has antibodies that react with the paternal human platelet antigen.

If a pregnant woman who has negative test results for the human platelet antigen has a fetus that has positive test results for the human platelet antigen (inherited from the father), maternal platelet antibodies can cross into the fetus and lead to intrauterine thrombocytopenia. In a future pregnancy, prenatal treatment initiated at 12 or 20 weeks' gestation with intravenous immunoglobulin with or without prednisone has been clearly shown to be of benefit when sensitization is known to exist. Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling and platelet transfusions may help to treat fetal thrombocytopenia and minimize the risk of an intracranial hemorrhage.

intensity of treatment will vary based on the patient's anticipated risk of thrombosis. For example, a patient with a history of thrombosis prior to the pregnancy is at high risk of thrombosis, and low-dose aspirin and complete heparin anticoagulation during pregnancy is recommended. For a patient without a prior pregnancy-related complication or thrombosis, low-dose aspirin or observation without medication is recommended.

## 122. D. Teratoma

The most common causes of a fetal neck mass are teratoma and cystic hygroma. Teratomas are typically solid but may have a cystic component. The mass is usually midline and is well circumscribed. Cystic hygromas are multi-septated masses with a cystic appearance and are more often located in the posterior neck. $^{1,2}$ They typically invade adjacent structures within the mouth or superior anterior mediastinum.

## 123. C. Stage III

In 1999, Quintero et al described an ultrasonographic staging system to predict the hemodynamic effect on the fetuses with twin-twin transfusion syndrome. $^{1}$ There are 5 stages with increasing severity.

- Stage I: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios, visible donor bladder
- Stage II: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios, donor bladder not visible
- Stage III: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios, abnormal umbilical Doppler flow (donor with absent or reversed end-diastolic flow in umbilical arteries, recipient with pulsatile flow in umbilical vein, and/or recipient with reversal of flow in the ductus venosus)
- Stage IV: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios and hydrops in either the donor or recipient
- Stage V: oligohydramnios/polyhydramnios and demise (impending or actual) in one or both twins

The ultrasonographic findings in the patient described in this vignette are most consistent with stage III.

The histopathology of the umbilical cord lesions described in this vignette is most consistent with an infection by Candida species. Although Candida albicans is the most common type of species in this scenario, other species have been described, such as Candida parapsilosis. Regardless of the type of Candida species, the infected umbilical cord typically has visible pinpoint yellow-white nodules, which are consistent with subamnionic microabscesses by histology. Necrotizing funisitis might also be apparent by histopathology.

## 125. A. First-trimester ultrasonography

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend that the most accurate method for estimating gestational age and due date is first-trimester ultrasonography (up to and including $13\%$ weeks' gestation). $^{1}$ This first trimester assessment is based on measuring the crown-rump length, which has an accuracy of $\pm 5$ to 7 days. $^{2,3}$ If a woman conceives by assisted reproductive technology, the gestational age derived from the procedure should be used to determine the estimated due date.

Animal and human studies in adults have shown that uninterrupted chest compressions, as well as systemic vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, can enhance diastolic blood pressure during CPR. These studies have demonstrated that continuous chest compressions without rescue breathing significantly reduce the time to return of spontaneous circulation and increase survival.¹,² Guidelines for adults and children (but not the neonatal population) recommend that bystander CPR be performed without rescue breaths and that in lone-rescuer advanced CPR, chest compressions should be uninterrupted for the first few minutes.³ After a secure airway has been established, continuous chest compressions with asynchronous ventilations are recommended.³,⁴

5. C. Increasing functional residual capacity, decreasing resistance, increasing lung compliance.

As a preterm neonate takes its first breaths after delivery, more air will enter than leave the lungs, thereby creating the functional residual capacity. The functional residual capacity is the gas volume in the lung at the end of expiration.¹ Over the first minutes to hours after birth, the functional residual capacity and lung compliance both increase, and resistance will decrease.

8. C. Randomized studies begin as high-quality evidence but may be downgraded because of methodological quality.

Randomized studies begin as high quality but may be downgraded for methodological quality, whereas observational or cohort studies begin as low quality and can be further downgraded or upgraded, depending on methodological quality or positive outcome effect.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) is an emerging consensus process that rates quality of evidence and strength of recommendations along with values and preferences.¹,² In brief, GRADE classifies quality of evidence as follows: high quality (there is high confidence in the estimate of effect as reported in a synthesis of the literature), moderate quality (there is moderate confidence, but there may be differences from a further elucidated truth), low quality (there is low confidence in the estimate of the effect, which may be substantially different from the true effect), and very low quality (it is possible that the estimate of effect is substantially different from the true effect). The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of 5 unique domains: the risk of bias for each outcome as reported across relevant studies (methodological quality), as well as the directness of evidence (such as whether the population studied is the same as that for which the guideline will be used), heterogeneity of the results of individual studies, precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias.

The Neonatal Resuscitation Program is the education program that translates the 2015 American Academy of Pediatrics/American Heart Association neonatal resuscitation guidelines, which is based on a review of the evidence by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation.¹

In the scenario where the neonate is born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid and is vigorous with good respiratory effort and muscle tone, the neonate may stay with the mother to receive the initial steps of newborn care. However, if the neonate presents with poor muscle tone and inadequate breathing efforts, the initial steps of resuscitation should be completed under the radiant warmer. Positive-pressure ventilation should be initiated if the neonate is not breathing or the heart rate is less than 100/min after the initial steps are completed.

10. A. A Cochrane meta-analysis has concluded that plastic wraps or bags are effective at reducing heat loss in neonates born younger than 28-weeks' gestational age.

Occlusive wraps, made of polyethylene or similar material, are a useful component of thermal management for preterm neonates at birth. A Cochrane meta-analysis reviewed several studies on plastic wraps or bags and found a benefit of increased temperature.¹ For the outcome of prevention of hypothermia, a number needed to treat of 4 was estimated. In general, no serious harm has been found from use of plastic wraps.

11. E. The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of axillary temperature between 36.5°C and 37.5°C among neonates.

The temperature of a fetus is 0.9°F (0.5°C) above the maternal temperature. However, within a few minutes after birth, the neonatal core temperature will decrease.¹ Preterm neonates may have an initial appropriate response to a decrease in environmental temperatures; however, the effect is limited, and there is a high risk for hypothermia. The World Health Organization recommends that the newborn axillary temperature be maintained between 97.7°F and 99.5°F (36.5°C and 37.5°C).²

12. E. One rationale for this ratio is the higher physiological heart rate of 120 to 160 beats per minute and breathing rates of 40 to 60 per minute in neonates.

The neonatal section of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation continues to recommend a 3:1 ratio of compressions to ventilation, with 90 compressions and 30 breaths per minute to achieve 120 events per minute.¹,² The rationale is based on the higher physiological heart rate of 120 to 160 per minute and breathing rates of 40 to 60 per minute in neonates compared with those in older patients. Another reason for this strategy is that bradycardia or cardiac arrest in neonates is usually caused by hypoxia rather than primary cardiac compromise. Therefore, providing ventilation is more likely to be beneficial than is providing chest compressions.

13. A. Early continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may prevent the need for subsequent mechanical ventilation by forming and maintaining a sufficient functional residual capacity and a large enough tidal volume.

CPAP supports end-expiratory lung volume and can reduce alveolar collapse and epithelial injury and helps to conserve endogenous surfactant. A combination of these mechanisms can reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. Several randomized controlled trials have compared early CPAP to intubation and ventilation with surfactant with outcomes similar between groups, suggesting that early CPAP may obviate the need for invasive ventilation.¹⁻⁴

15. D. Heat loss via conduction occurs when neonates are in direct contact with cold surfaces.

Heat loss occurs by means of 4 mechanisms that are all relevant for the risk of hypothermia in preterm neonates¹:

1. Evaporation: amniotic fluid covering the skin exposed to the relatively nonhumidified air in the delivery room leads to evaporation
2. Conduction: direct contact between the neonate and the surrounding environment and objects, such as cold blankets
3. Convection: the gradient between the temperature of the skin of the neonate and movement of ambient air, such as when the neonate is moved from the mother to a resuscitation table
4. Radiation: the gradient between the skin and surrounding surfaces not touching the neonate

There is evidence that a delay of cord clamping by at least 30 seconds after birth results in improved outcomes, particularly if the neonate begins breathing before the cord is clamped.¹ The scientific review from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation reported that DCC is associated with increased placental transfusion, increased cardiac output, more stable and higher neonatal blood pressure, less intraventricular hemorrhage of any grade, less need for transfusion after birth, and less necrotizing enterocolitis.¹ The neonatal guidelines state: "DCC [delayed cord clamping] for longer than 30 seconds is reasonable for both term and preterm infants who do not require resuscitation at birth. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend an approach to cord clamping for preterm infants who do receive resuscitation immediately after birth."¹,²

21. B. Higher mean ventilation rates are observed with the use of a compression:ventilation ratio of 3:1 compared with those seen with ratios of 5:1 or 15:2.

Manikin studies have shown higher ventilation rates when the compression:ventilation ratio is 3:1 than with higher ratios of compression to ventilation.¹⁻³ In 1 manikin study, chest compression depth during resuscitation with a 3:1 compression:ventilation ratio was higher and more consistent than with higher ratios.³

Face mask leak is a common issue in neonatal resuscitation. When there is minimal leak, one would expect flow to return to 0 and the inspired and expired tidal volumes to be fairly equal. A large leak would be indicated by the flow not returning to 0 and the expired tidal volume to be much smaller than the inspired tidal volume.¹

## 26. C. Infant mortality

A Cochrane review of randomized or quasi-randomized studies enrolling a total of 1,302 newborns and comparing room air versus 100% oxygen for neonatal resuscitation was published in 2005.¹ No individual study found a significant difference in mortality between groups; however, pooled analysis showed a benefit of reduced mortality in the group receiving room air. No significant differences were seen for the outcomes of neurological development or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

A neonate's initial response to cool external temperatures involves stimulation of skin thermoreceptors leading to nonshivering thermogenesis. Stimulation of sympathetic pathways induces thyrotropin release that then leads to release of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. Triiodothyronine causes upregulation of the protein thermogenin, which causes uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidation and phosphorylation. Thermogenin and norepinephrine act on brown fat to initiate chemical thermogenesis.¹

Neonates who breathe spontaneously can generate fairly high transpulmonary pressures immediately after birth.¹ However, the use of high pressures with manual positive-pressure ventilation can increase the risk of lung injury.² Increasing the time over which pressure is applied may help to minimize injury. Applying positive end-expiratory pressure will help to maintain pressure on the airways throughout the respiratory cycle.

## 34. A. Preterm neonates can maintain core temperatures in only a narrow range of environmental temperatures.

Preterm neonates are at a high risk for hypothermia because they can maintain core temperatures in only a narrow range of environmental temperatures. Also, their ratio of skin surface to body weight is almost 4 times that of adults, whereas term neonates have a ratio 3 times that of adults. This larger skin surface area leads to more heat loss. Preterm neonates' sweat glands are not functional, and vasodilation is inefficient. $^{1}$

35. B. Help the newborn form a sufficient functional residual capacity and large enough tidal volume
Very preterm newborns have a pliable and unstable chest wall and underdeveloped respiratory muscles, creating a challenge in forming effective functional residual capacity. The most important first step in aiding the transition to effective breathing is to help the newborn form and maintain sufficient functional residual capacity and tidal volume. This can be facilitated by providing and maintaining positive end-expiratory pressure soon after birth.¹

37. E. There is currently insufficient evidence to support specific treatment recommendations for maternal temperature regarding neonatal temperature regulation.
Several randomized trials in which the investigators used interventions to prevent maternal hypothermia during spinal anesthesia and cesarean section have shown higher neonatal temperatures in the intervention groups.¹⁻³ Maternal hyperthermia has been associated with increased mortality, neonatal seizures, and encephalopathy in neonates, but there are no data to suggest that active reduction of elevated maternal temperature benefits the neonate.⁴⁵ Therefore, there is currently insufficient evidence to support specific treatment recommendations for maternal temperature in relation to neonatal temperature regulation.

38. E. Untreated hypothermia eventually leads to altered physiological characteristics and may cause seizure activity or even death.
Temperature regulation is linked to oxygen consumption and glucose use.¹² Cold stress leads to increased oxygen consumption, tissue hypoxia, and metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis can then inhibit surfactant formation. Norepinephrine released from brown fat can lead to systemic vasoconstriction, which leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction, and can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. Heat loss can contribute to dehydration and fluid electrolyte imbalance. Untreated hypothermia may eventually lead to altered physiological characteristics and seizure activity and, in some cases, may be a factor in increasing the risk for mortality.

39. C. Many neonates of extremely low gestational age who are treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) from birth have outcomes at least as good as those of neonates who are intubated for ventilation but without the complications of ventilation.

CPAP can support end-expiratory lung volume, reduce alveolar collapse, and help to conserve surfactant. Randomized controlled trials have compared early CPAP to intubation and ventilation with surfactant, with outcomes similar between groups, suggesting that early CPAP may obviate the need for invasive ventilation.¹⁻⁴

40. D. It involves rolling the mask onto the face, beginning at the tip of the chin, rather than placing the mask straight onto the face.

Correct placement of a mask for neonatal resuscitation requires several components, including an adequate chin lift, correct position of the mask, and technique of placement. The mask should be placed on the tip of the chin, covering mouth and nose, but not the eyes. A more accurate positioning and better seal may be achieved by rolling the mask onto the face beginning at the tip of the chin rather than placing the mask straight onto the face.¹ The optimal method may depend on the type of mask used.¹

Although flow-inflating bags may be more difficult to learn to use than are self-inflating bags, flow-inflating bags allow for more immediate attention to a leak at the mask or a lack of adequate gas flow because the bag will collapse.¹ Also, unlike self-inflating bags, flow-inflating bags can provide positive end-expiratory pressure.

42. B. Glutamate

When cell membrane functions fail, excitatory amino acids, primarily glutamate, accumulate in the extracellular space because of increased release and impaired uptake.¹ The secondary neurotoxic cascade is initiated as the accumulation of glutamate leads to overactivation of neuronal receptors, including the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, which leads to an excessive influx of calcium. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration leads to activation of cell-degrading enzymes such as lipases, proteases, phospholipases, and endonucleases.

43. B. Diastolic blood pressure

In experimental models of adult ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest to determine the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, aortic diastolic blood pressure or coronary perfusion pressure are the most reliable measurements.¹⁻⁴ A hypoxic heart that is depleted of energy substrate requires reestablishment of myocardial perfusion with oxygenated blood. During cardiac compressions, blood pumped out of the heart will take the path of least resistance. In the scenario of asphyxia in which there is vasodilation and no or minimal diastolic blood pressure, the blood pumped by compressions will preferentially flow through the aorta and the periphery rather than into the narrow-diameter coronary arteries that have higher resistance.

Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is more sensitive at detecting hypoxic-ischemic injury than brain magnetic resonance imaging in the first 24-hour period after the injury, when diffusion-weighed imaging sequences may be falsely negative.¹ Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can detect increases in brain lactate concentrations as early as 2 to 8 hours after injury, making MRS the earliest imaging diagnostic tool for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.²

## 9. C. Myotonic dystrophy

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that can present in the newborn period with hypotonia, respiratory distress, poor feeding, clubfoot, and eyelid ptosis. The physical examination may reveal bitemporal wasting, a masklike facies, and a tented upper lip. The prenatal history may be significant for a history of decreased fetal movement, polyhydramnios, and breech positioning.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is caused by expansion of trinucleotide CTG repeats in the noncoding region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene on chromosome 19. A trinucleotide repeat size greater than 34 is unstable, resulting in possible expansion during female germline cell division, a process known as anticipation. A CTG repeat length between 37 and 50 is considered a premutation state, and individuals in this category are asymptomatic or have very subtle clinical features.

The diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy is confirmed by the detection of a CTG repeat length greater than 50, and the length of the CTG repeats determines disease severity.¹,²

- Mild DM1 (50–150 repeats)
- Classic DM1 (100–1,000 repeats)
- Congenital DM1 (&gt;1,000 repeats)

# 10. C. Morphine

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is the result of the abrupt discontinuation of chronic fetal exposure to substances used or abused by the mother during pregnancy. NAS most commonly follows opioid exposure, but polydrug use can lead to a more severe presentation. It is a generalized multisystem disorder with central nervous system, autonomic nervous system, and gastrointestinal system symptomatology.

The mainstay of therapy for neonates with NAS is centered on nonpharmacological measures and family-focused care. For newborns with opioid withdrawal and who require pharmacological intervention, morphine has been shown to be more effective than paregoric alone or paregoric and diazepam. In addition, the use of paregoric is not recommended because most preparations contain alcohol, benzoic acid, and camphor. The use of phenobarbital as a first-line therapy for a newborn with opioid withdrawal is not indicated. Similarly, diazepam contains sodium benzoate, which may displace bilirubin, is poorly metabolized by neonates, and should not be used in the treatment of NAS.¹

# 11. D. Shoulder dystocia

Perinatal brachial plexus palsy is a peripheral nerve injury that increases in incidence with increasing birth weight.

- 0.9 per 1,000 for newborns weighing less than 4,000 g
- 1.8 per 1,000 for newborns weighing 4,000 to 4,500 g
- 2.6 per 1,000 for newborns weighing more than 4,500 g¹

Perinatal brachial plexus palsy is commonly associated with traumatic birth, but not always, and can lead to significant long-term disability. Risk factors include the following:

- Maternal factors: excessive weight gain, maternal short stature, maternal diabetes, uterine abnormalities, and history of a previous pregnancy complicated by shoulder dystocia
- Fetal factors: fetal macrosomia, as discussed above
- Parturitional factors: shoulder dystocia, prolonged labor, assisted delivery, breech delivery, and post-term delivery

Among these risk factors, shoulder dystocia is the most common, occurring in 45% of newborns.²

## 14. D. Limb clonus

Movement abnormalities due to seizures are difficult to ascertain in the neonatal period because of incomplete brain myelination. Neonatal seizures typically present as focal clonic, focal tonic, generalized tonic, myoclonic, and subtle seizures. In general, abnormal movement caused by seizures is stereotypical and cannot be stopped.

There are multiple types of nonepileptic movement disorders to consider as part of the differential diagnosis of abnormal movements in the neonatal period.¹ These can be interrupted with repositioning or arousal and include the following:

- Jittery movements: very rapid, short duration tremulous movements usually involving multiple extremities
- Limb clonus: rapid and short duration jerking movement, typically restricted to one joint as in the clinical vignette described
- Benign sleep myoclonus: rapid jerking movements randomly affecting the extremities, trunk, and face, and resolving with arousal

Exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in utero has been associated with the following:

- A small increase in the risk of neurological anomalies in some studies, mostly driven by exposure to fluoxetine and paroxetine.¹,²
- The occurrence of neonatal adaptation syndrome with symptoms such as hypertonia, tremors, jitteriness, feeding issues, difficulty sleeping, and respiratory distress. Symptoms are typically mild, resolve within 2 to 6 days, and respond well to nonpharmacological measures including skin-to-skin care.³
- Altered neurobehavior and motor development in the early postnatal period.⁴
- Altered pain response with increased pain tolerance as demonstrated by decreased physiological response and crying in response to stimuli such as heel sticks. There are no long-term data to support an effect of SSRI exposure on response to pain in later life.⁵
- Decreased fetal head growth and higher fetal weight gain compared with fetuses of pregnant women with depression but not taking SSRIs.⁶

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is global problem, with reports of rapidly increasing incidence in developed and developing countries. In the United States, a 3-fold increase in NAS occurred between 2000 and 2009, and the rate of NAS has continued to increase since then, outpacing projections. This increase in NAS frequency has matched the increase in opioid use in mothers and is another marker of the opioid crisis that the United States is currently experiencing. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, approximately one-third of reproductive-aged women filled an opioid prescription from 2008 to 2012. In addition, while the development of medication-assisted treatment programs for opioid addiction has led to improved outcomes, it has also been associated with increased NAS frequency.¹⁻⁴

Children born preterm are at increased risk of developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD).¹ On average, ASD is not diagnosed until after age 4 years, although research indicates that diagnosis at age 2 years is feasible, valid, and stable.²³ Earlier diagnosis is possible using screening tools such as the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT). The M-CHAT is brief and can be administered to parents of children between 18 months and 24 months at high risk for ASD.⁴

The following deviations in development have been proposed by the American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society as absolute red flags for possible ASD:

- No babbling, pointing, or use of nonverbal gestures by 12 months
- No single words by 16 months
- No 2-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months
- Loss of language or social skills at any age⁵

## 20. B. Children who achieve head control by 9 months of age and who are sitting by 2 years of age, and have suppression of primitive reflexes by 18 to 24 months of age, are more likely to achieve eventual ambulation than those who do not achieve those milestones.

The risk of cerebral palsy (CP) increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) at birth, with an incidence between 15% and 20% among neonates born at fewer than 25 weeks’ GA.¹ Cerebral palsy is classified from 1 to 5 in order of increasing severity using the Gross Motor Function Classification System.²

Most preterm neonates with CP will be able to walk, either independently (58%) or with assistance (11%).³ Children who will ultimately be able to ambulate are more likely to have achieved the following:

- Head control by 9 months of age
- Sitting by 2 years of age
- Suppression of primitive reflexes by 18 to 24 months of age⁴⁵

The most common form of CP in children born preterm is spastic diplegia (&gt;75% of cases). Most children with spastic diplegia will be able to walk (with or without assistance), perform independent care, and have bowel-bladder control. However, about one-third of these children will have cognitive impairments. Those with spastic hemiplegia have a higher risk of cognitive and learning impairments (two-thirds of children) but are typically able to walk by age 3 years. More than 50% of children with the dystonic forms have normal intelligence but have problems with speech and articulation, movement control, drooling, and swallowing.

## 21. B. Newborns in the prenatal surgery group in the MOMS trial had increased urological complications compared with the postnatal intervention group.

Myelomeningocele are neural tube defects that occur with an incidence of about 2.0 per 1,000 births.¹ The care of neonates with myelomeningocele includes the following:

- Defect closure, prenatally or postnatally
- Surveillance and treatment of hydrocephalus
- Long-term multidisciplinary care

The Management of Myelomeningocele Study trial was designed to compare outcomes of prenatal and postnatal surgery in children with myelomeningocele.² This randomized, multicenter trial was stopped early because of a significant decrease in the need for cerebrospinal fluid shunting in the prenatal intervention group (65% vs 92%, P &lt; .001). At 12 months, children who underwent prenatal surgery had decreased hindbrain herniation. At 30 months, more children in the prenatal surgery group were able to walk. The risks of prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele include maternal morbidity, preterm birth, and increased urological complications.³,⁴

Prenatal surgery may be considered if the following inclusion criteria from the MOMS trial are met:

- Singleton pregnancy
- Spinal level between T1 and S1
- Normal karyotype
- Presence of an Arnold-Chiari malformation type II²

## 22. E. Lower margin below 5 μV and upper margin below 10 μV

Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) allows for continuous and noninvasive brain monitoring at the bedside. Advantages over full montage electroencephalography (EEG) include that it does not require an EEG technician for lead placement, and bedside clinicians with no neurophysiology background can interpret the aEEG with appropriate training.

Several classification systems for the interpretation of the aEEG background activity have been developed. The basic classification developed by al Naqeeb and colleagues¹ distinguishes 3 patterns based on voltage assessment.

- Normal: lower margin above 5 μV and upper margin above 10 μV
- Moderately abnormal: lower margin below 5 μV and upper margin above 10 μV
- Suppressed: lower margin below 5 μV and upper margin below 10 μV

This classification is helpful in evaluating neonates with encephalopathy.

More applicable to all neonates is the 5-pattern classification developed by Hellström-Westas and colleagues.²

- Continuous activity: lower amplitude of 5 to 7 μV (up to 10 μV); maximum amplitude of 10 to 25 μV (up to 50 μV)
- Discontinuous activity: variable lower border variable (&lt;5 μV with maximum amplitude &gt;10 μV), leading to a wider bandwidth
- Burst suppression: discontinuous background with minimum amplitude without variability (0–2 μV) and bursts with amplitude &gt;25 μV. Two types of burst suppression pattern are distinguished: positive burst suppression (≥100 bursts per hour) and negative burst suppression (&lt;100 bursts per hour)
- Low-voltage pattern: continuous background pattern of very low amplitude of about 5 μV
- Flat or isoelectric tracing: extremely low background amplitude (significantly below 5 μV)

## 23. E. Hypothermia reduces calcium influx into neuronal cells, potentially reducing the degree of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to be neuroprotective in term and near-term neonates with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.¹ The beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia are due to its effect on multiple cellular and metabolic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.² These mechanisms include the following:

- Decrease in the tissue metabolic demand, including cerebral metabolic rate
- Decrease in ionic perturbation with decreased intracellular calcium influx and mitochondrial dysfunction, and thereby neurotoxicity
- Decreased free radical production
- Attenuation of the proinflammatory cascade activation, including reduction in STAT 3 expression
- Enhanced RBM3 protein expression, a protein with antiapoptotic and cell proliferation functions

## 24. B. Focal tonic seizure

Neonatal seizures can be differentiated from nonepileptic abnormal movements of the newborn because of their stereotypical nature and the fact that they cannot be stopped with repositioning or arousal.

Neonatal seizures are classified as follows:

- Focal (multifocal) clonic seizures, characterized by slow (0.5–2.0 per second) rhythmic jerking of an extremity, or twitching of the face. These are classically associated with a seizure on electroencephalogram (EEG).
- Focal tonic seizures, characterized by stereotypical, slowly evolving stiffening and posturing of an extremity, or asymmetrical posturing of the trunk and neck, with or without associated eye deviation. These are classically associated with a seizure on EEG.
- Generalized tonic seizures, characterized by whole-body stiffening with upper and lower extremities extension. These are not typically associated with rhythmic discharge on EEG and may represent a brainstem release phenomenon.
- Myoclonic seizures, characterized by rapid, single jerks of a limb and/or trunk. They can be distinguished from benign sleep myoclonus by their persistence and lack of correlation with sleep.
- Subtle seizures (motor or autonomic), characterized by stereotyped episodes of eye deviation and nystagmus, chewing movements, rhythmic tongue thrusting, swimming movements of the arms, or bicycling movements of the legs. Autonomic signs include tachycardia, apnea, and abrupt changes in blood pressure. The presence of an EEG correlate is inconsistent.

## 25. E. The randomized trials for therapeutic hypothermia employed either a combination of head and body cooling or whole-body cooling alone, with core temperatures typically a degree lower in the whole-body cooling trials.

Several large randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that therapeutic hypothermia is effective in improving the outcomes of newborns (≥35 or ≥36 weeks' gestation) with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.¹

Eligibility for therapeutic hypothermia was determined in a 2-step process for all these trials.²

- Biological evidence of a hypoxic-ischemic event around the time of delivery. While criteria varied slightly between trials,² all included a surrogate of impaired placental gas exchange (metabolic acidosis at birth, a low 10-minute Apgar score, or continued need for resuscitation at 10 minutes after birth).
- Presence of moderate or severe encephalopathy based on neurological examination with half of the trials using an amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram to confirm moderate or severe encephalopathy.

Neurology

In all cases, therapeutic hypothermia was achieved via either whole-body cooling or selective head cooling with mild systemic cooling. Core temperatures (rectal or esophageal) were 1° lower in the total body cooling trials compared to the selective head cooling trials. All trials maintained hypothermia for a total duration of 72 hours, followed by a slow rewarming period.²³

## 26. D. Reduced white matter in the premotor, sensorimotor, and temporal cortices and reduced gray matter volumes in the sensorimotor and mid-temporal cortices have been associated with poor cognitive outcomes.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool to predict the neurodevelopmental consequences of prematurity. Conventional and advanced MRI sequences can be used in this population. Conventional imaging sequences include T1- and T2-weighed images and are useful to

- Determine and classify white matter abnormalities. The presence of moderate to severe white matter abnormalities and asymmetrical myelination of the posterior limb of the internal capsule are strong risk factors of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.¹²
- Identify and classify cerebellar hemorrhages.
- Investigate cerebral and cerebellar growth and development. Advanced imaging sequences include
- Volumetric and surface-based morphometry to investigate macrostructural brain development. Using these techniques, investigators determined that reduced white matter volumes in the premotor, sensorimotor, and temporal cortices and reduced gray matter volumes in the sensorimotor and mid-temporal cortices were associated with poor cognitive outcomes.³
- Diffusion tensor imaging and measurement of fractional anisotropy (FA) to investigate the microstructural integrity of the brain. Fractional anisotropy increases with advancing development, and lower FA values have been shown to correlate with motor and cognitive outcomes.⁴⁵

## 27. B. Mechanical ventilation in neonates is associated with an increase in cortisol and catecholamine levels.

Mechanical ventilation, sometimes for prolonged periods, is necessary in the care of sick preterm and term neonates. While the use of mechanical ventilation is associated with an increase in cortisol and catecholamine levels, the routine use of narcotic sedation is not recommended for the following reasons:

- The use of advanced modes of ventilation has greatly decreased the risk of asynchronous respiratory effort with subsequent compromised gas exchange and increased stress responses.
- The preemptive use of morphine in mechanically ventilated neonates has not been shown to lead to a measurable analgesic effect.
- The randomized controlled NEOPAIN trial reported no beneficial effect of preemptive morphine infusions with an increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm neonates born at 27 to 29 weeks' gestation. Neonates receiving additional morphine doses required longer mechanical ventilation support.¹
- A Cochrane review determined that preemptive opioid sedation did not result in any differences in mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or short- and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

## 28. A. Her glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were likely to be elevated during the first 2 days after delivery.

Multiple biomarkers of neonatal hypoxic brain injury have been studied, including the following:

- Protein S100β. Elevated S100β levels are seen in the cord blood or first urine of neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) compared with control participants. A cord blood level greater than 2.02 mcg/L has a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 88% for predicting the moderate or severe HIE.¹
- Neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Elevated serum NSE levels (&gt;40 mcg/L) between 4 hours and 48 hours after birth are predictive of neonates with moderate to severe HIE.²
- Umbilical cord interleukin 6 (IL-6). Elevated IL-6 levels in the neonate but not the mother correlate with the severity of HIE as well as with 2-year neurodevelopmental outcomes.³
- Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). GFAP level is elevated after HIE and serum levels 0.15 ng/mL or greater on neonatal intensive care unit admission have been shown to be predictive of abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging findings.⁴
- Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Neonates with HIE have higher BDNF level in cord plasma.⁵

## 29. B. Even if this patient had a normal hearing screening result in the NICU, the patient is at risk for delayed-onset or progressive hearing loss and will require repeat testing.

Neonates born preterm have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairments, emphasizing the need for careful follow-up after neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge to detect problems early, implement timely interventions, and optimize outcomes. Recommendations specific to the neurodevelopmental monitoring in the NICU population include the following:

- Recognition of the increased risk of cerebral palsy, including preterm neonates with a history of normal head ultrasounds (4% risk).¹
- Recognition of neonates at higher risk of developing seizures, including those with a history of intraventricular hemorrhage (10% risk),² periventricular leukomalacia (18% risk),³ or moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (29%-35% risk).⁴
- Close monitoring for shunt malfunction in neonates with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. In addition, neonates should be monitored for the development of late ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus and need for post-discharge shunt placement.
- Emphasizing the importance of ophthalmology follow-up for preterm neonates with or without retinopathy of prematurity.
- Ongoing surveillance for the development of hearing impairments. The goals of universal hearing screening programs are 3-fold: (1) screen all neonates for hearing loss by 1 month of age; (2) perform diagnostic audiological evaluations by 3 months of age; and (3) enroll eligible infants in early intervention no later than 6 months after birth. Risk indicators associated with hearing loss include NICU stay longer than 5 days, exposure to ototoxic medications, hyperbilirubinemia with bilirubin level greater than 20 mg/dL, in utero infection (cytomegalovirus, Zika, rubella, syphilis, toxoplasmosis), and craniofacial anomalies involving the ear and/or temporal bone.

factors are of higher concern and include addressing caregiver concern, family history of permanent childhood hearing loss, syndromes associated with progressive hearing loss, neurodegenerative disorders, trauma, history of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or chemotherapy, and culture-positive postnatal infections associated with sensorineural hearing loss, requiring earlier repeat diagnostic audiology assessments. Neonates with risk factors, such as the neonate described in the vignette, should have repeat diagnostic audiology assessment by 24 to 30 months of age. Earlier evaluation is recommended for neonates with high-risk indicators.⁵,⁶

## 30. C. If this neonate has hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, there is likely to be an increased synaptic release of glutamate and over-activation of glutamate neuronal receptors.

The pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) results from an interruption of the metabolic substrates necessary for brain metabolism, particularly oxygen and glucose. It evolves in 2 phases.¹

- The first phase includes immediate cell death due to necrosis as a result of interruption of substrates delivery.
- The second phase is characterized by the complex activation of several intracellular pathways including
- Excitotoxicity, characterized by increased synaptic release of glutamate with over-activation of glutamate neuronal receptors
- Free radical production leading to increase in oxidative stress, and neuronal injury
- Activation of inflammatory cascades

Therapeutic hypothermia is effective in improving the outcomes of neonates with moderate to severe HIE because it targets many of these mechanisms resulting in decreased secondary cell death, or apoptosis.²

## 31. B. A study by Clements and colleagues found an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder associated with maternal SSRI use.

Exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been associated with alterations in neurobehavior and development. One of the major concerns is an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A meta-analysis of observational studies demonstrated an increased risk of ASD with a pooled crude odds ratio of 1.91 (95% CI, 1.13-3.47).¹ This association was replicated in a prospective study of 376 children.² However, the data remain conflicting with 2 additional studies finding no association between SSRI exposure and ASD.³,⁴ In the study from Clements and colleagues, an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children exposed to SSRIs was noted.⁴

32. B. In contrast to having central nervous system causes of hypotonia, neonates with peripheral nerve disorders do not usually show improvement in their muscle strength or tone.

An approach focusing on anatomical-clinical correlation is recommended for the systematic evaluation of the hypotonic newborn. Localization between upper motor neuron (central) and lower motor neuron (peripheral), while not perfect, is helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis and directing diagnostic testing.¹²

Hypotonia due to peripheral nerve disorders is characterized by the following distinguishing features³:

- Weakness (distal greater than proximal)
- Muscle atrophy
- Possible contractures; may be as extensive as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita
- Possible muscle fasciculations because of denervated muscle fibers (less common than seen with anterior horn cell disorders)
- Diminished or absent reflexes
- Normal or increased protein level on cerebrospinal fluid studies
- Normal creatine kinase level
- Decreased motor nerve conduction velocity

In contrast to having central nervous system causes of hypotonia, neonates with peripheral nerve disorders do not usually show improvement in their muscle strength or tone. Peripheral disorders are classified as generalized or focal (ie, brachial plexus injury). Generalized neuropathies include

- Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (eg, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease).
- Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies. Familial dysautonomia (or Riley-Day syndrome) is the best described of these neuropathies.
- Acquired demyelinating neuropathies, which rarely present in the neonatal period.

Developmentally supportive interventions and family-centered care are important aspects in the care of preterm neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Developmental care is centered on individualized care based on newborn behavior and cues. Several methods have been developed to better assess and understand the competencies of an individual newborn. These methods include the following:

- The Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale, developed to assess the neurological development and maturity of the term newborn.¹
- The NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), also intended for newborns. The NNNS can also be used to assess neonates with a history of prenatal drug exposure.²
- The Assessment of Preterm Infants' Behavior, developed to assess the behavior of preterm newborns and used before they reach term equivalent age.³
- The Infant Behavioral Assessment and Intervention Program, developed to assess the behavior of the newborn after discharge from the nursery.⁴

## 34. A. Hydrocephalus

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CTG repeats in the noncoding region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene on chromosome 19. The prenatal care of women with DM1 or with a family history of DM1 should be provided by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist due to the increased risk associated with fetal DM1 including higher rates of¹

- Spontaneous abortions
- Preterm labor
- Preeclampsia
- Spontaneous premature rupture of membranes
- Peripartum hemorrhage

In a pregnant woman with a family history of DM1 or with grip myotonia, the following findings would increase the suspicion of DM1 in the fetus²:

- Polyhydramnios (secondary to swallowing difficulties)
- Ventriculomegaly or hydrocephalus
- Talipes equinovarus
- Decreased fetal movements

## 35. A. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody assay

Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis (TNMG) affects 10% to 20% of newborns born to mothers with myasthenia gravis. Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis is caused by the transplacental passage of antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR, 85% of cases) or against the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSKR, 15% of cases), causing neuromuscular junction blockade in the newborn.¹

In an asymptomatic mother, the diagnosis of TNMG may be missed; therefore, TNMG should remain on the differential diagnosis of a newborn presenting with generalized hypotonia and poor suck between 3 and 72 hours after birth. Other clinical findings suggestive of TNMG include weak cry, facial diplegia or paresis, and swallowing difficulties, as well as, in some cases, respiratory distress and ptosis.² In this situation, the concomitant measurement of anti-AChR and anti-MuSKR antibodies in both mother and newborn is diagnostic.

## 36. D. Timing of initiation of cooling

The neuroprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia are dependent on several factors including timing of initiation of cooling as well as depth and duration of cooling. Among those, the timing of initiation of cooling is the most important. Preclinical data support a loss of neuroprotection if cooling is delayed by longer than 6 hours. Further, the degree of neuroprotection decreases with delays of cooling onset by longer than a few hours after the hypoxic-ischemic insult.¹

The primary cellular target in periventricular white matter injury or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is the pre-myelinating oligodendrocyte (PreOLs). These PreOLs, which are present at high concentration in the periventricular region between 23 weeks' gestation and 32 weeks' gestation, are particularly susceptible to hypoxia-ischemia, free radical injury, excitotoxicity, and inflammation, all factors implicated in the pathogenesis of PVL.¹⁻³

38. B. Children with this disorder usually do not have problems with early milestone acquisition.

Developmental coordination disorder (DCD), a milder form of motor disability than cerebral palsy, is defined as "an impairment of motor performance sufficient to produce functional performance deficits not explicable by the child's age or intellect, or by other diagnosable neurological or psychiatric disorder."¹

The incidence of DCD is higher among children born with a birth weight less than 1,000 g (5%–50%, with most studies reporting a 30% incidence) compared with children born with normal birth weight (2%).²³ Other risk factors of DCD include male sex, prolonged rupture of membranes, retinopathy of prematurity, and postnatal steroid exposure.⁴⁵

Children with DCD have an increased risk of cognitive and academic difficulties, behavioral problems, and social isolation.

39. E. Referral to a specialist familiar with ASD should occur; these may include developmental and behavioral pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, or child and adolescent psychiatrists.

Children born preterm, with a low birth weight, or with neonatal medical complexity have an increased risk of having autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In a prospective study with rigorous diagnosis of ASD, children born preterm were found to have a prevalence of ASD of 5%, 3 times that of the general population.¹ Therefore, screening for ASD using tools such as the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), is recommended in the follow-up care of these high-risk children. The M-CHAT is a short screening tool administered to parents at the 18- and 24-month visits.²

If a child is suspected of having ASD, referral to a specialist should occur as soon as possible to ensure accurate and prompt diagnosis as well as institution of appropriate educational and developmental interventions.

For children younger than 3 years at diagnosis, services are available through the state early intervention system. If they are older than 3 years, an individualized education program can be implemented through the public school system. Additional therapy services may also be available through the child's insurance.

40. E. To date, there have been no randomized clinical trials that have evaluated the effect of maintaining blood glucose concentration at designated levels after neonatal asphyxia.

Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is the result of substrate delivery interruption including oxygen and glucose. An important aspect of the post-injury care of these neonates is to maintain adequate substrate delivery to support recovery. Studies indicate that both hypoglycemia (particularly early after the insult) and hyperglycemia are associated with poor outcomes in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). However, to date there have been no randomized clinical trials that have evaluated the effect of maintaining blood glucose concentration at designated levels after neonatal HIE.¹⁻⁴

## 41. B. Collagen 1A1 gene

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type II is due to a sporadic mutation in the collagen 1A1 gene resulting in abnormal collagen fibrils in type I collagen.

Fetuses with OI type II have an increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. Clinically, OI type II is characterized by

- Short stature of prenatal onset
- Short and broad long bones with bowing
- Deep blue sclera
- Small nose with low nasal bridge, which may appear beaked
- Wormian skull
- Respiratory failure due to abnormal ribs with small chest and lung hypoplasia
- Cerebral cortex abnormalities including neuronal migration defects

Most fetuses with OI type II die in the neonatal period.¹

## 43. A. Initial arm and hand involvement in PBPP may affect subsequent cortical development even after full recovery of innervation.

Perinatal brachial plexus palsy (PBPP) is a peripheral nerve injury that is commonly associated with traumatic birth, but not always. Despite improvements in prenatal care, the rate of PBPP has remained stable over the past 3 decades, which may be due in part to an increase in population birth weights. Upper lesions (C5, C6, and ±C7) are more common than lower lesions (C8 and T1) or total lesions (C5–T1).

While the rates of recovery are high (historically reported to be as high as 90%), this may be an overestimate and more recent systematic reviews highlighted the persistence of residual deficits in 20% to 30% of patients.¹,² Lower lesions are more likely to result in long-term impairment than upper lesions (66% vs 21%).³ The recovery of biceps function within the first month after birth predicts full recovery of function by age 2.⁴ If the recovery in biceps function is delayed to 2 to 3 months after birth, full recovery is unlikely. Likewise, poor recovery beyond 3 months is predictive of long-term neurological deficits.⁴,⁵ One of the reasons for poor motor outcomes in some children with PBPP is suboptimal cortical development due to prolonged paralysis at a critical period of brain development.⁶

## 45. A. Core temperature is most stable and within the desired range when using whole-body cooling mattress with servo control.

Therapeutic hypothermia is standard of care for the treatment of neonates with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and is provided as whole-body or selective head cooling. Methods of effective whole-body cooling include servo-controlled cooling mattresses, ice bags, gloves filled with ice, and laminar flow cooling devices. In selective head cooling, active cooling is applied only to the cranium but does result in mild systemic cooling.¹

Core temperature (either esophageal or rectal) has been shown to be most stable when using a servo-controlled cooling mattress. In contrast, the use of water-filled gloves resulted in the least stable temperature maintenance of all the methods tested.

Most of the randomized controlled trials investigating therapeutic hypothermia aimed for a core temperature between 33°C to 34°C and 34°C to 35°C for 72 hours, followed by a slow rewarming phase, with a rewarming rate no faster than 0.5°C per hour.²

## 46. A. Benign neonatal seizure

Two types of benign neonatal seizure syndrome have been described.

- Benign familial neonatal convulsions, which are characterized by a family history of seizures in the neonatal period that spontaneously resolve after a few days or weeks.
- Benign neonatal seizures, which are characterized by onset of seizures between 4 days and 6 days after birth (fifth day fits) with no family history of seizures in the neonatal period.

In both cases, seizures are typically focal clonic and respond well to antiseizure medication. In addition, the neurological examination reveals normal findings, the background electroencephalographic finding is normal, and there are no risk factors for seizures. Antiseizure medications can typically be discontinued after a few weeks or months.¹,²

## 47. E. The onset of opiate withdrawal is 24 to 72 hours following birth but can appear as late as 5 to 7 days after delivery.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a multisystem disorder caused by the abrupt discontinuation of chronic fetal exposure to substances used or abused by the pregnant woman during pregnancy. It most commonly follows opioid exposure, but polydrug use can lead to a more severe presentation.¹

Chronic opioid use or abuse during pregnancy results in NAS in about 60% of exposed newborns with onset of symptoms typically between 24 hours and 72 hours after birth. It is important to recognize that a delayed presentation can occur, up to 5 to 7 days after birth.²,³

---

<!-- Page 555 -->

Neurology

The clinical presentation of NAS is variable and includes the following clinical features:

- Neuro-irritability: hypertonia, tremors, hyperreflexia, irritability and restlessness, high-pitched cry, poor sleep, and seizures (rare)
- Autonomic instability: yawning, nasal stuffiness, tachypnea, sweating, sneezing, fever, and skin mottling
- Gastrointestinal disturbances: diarrhea with possible diaper rash with skin excoriation, vomiting, poor feeding, and poor weight gain

In mothers on medication-assisted therapy and with no history of polydrug use, breastfeeding should be promoted and has been shown to be beneficial for both mother and baby.⁴

Toxicology testing is an important tool for the diagnosis of NAS and the recognition of other substance exposures. Cord and meconium drug testing are more sensitive than urine drug testing.⁵

## 48. D. Nemaline myopathy

Nemaline myopathy is one of the most common forms of congenital myopathy and occurs in 1 in 50,000 births. Pathogenic mutation in several genes have been identified (11 to date), most of them encoding sarcomeric thin filament proteins.¹,²

Newborns affected by nemaline myopathy present in the neonatal period with²

- Severe muscle weakness affecting the face, neck, and proximal limb muscles
- Hypotonia
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Arthrogyposis multiplex congenita
- Absent deep tendon reflexes

There may also be a history of poor fetal movement and polyhydramnios prenatally. Creatine kinase levels are typically normal. On muscle biopsy, characteristic nemaline rodlike inclusion bodies are seen throughout muscle fibers on modified Gomori trichome staining.

## 49. B. Distribution of oligodendrocyte progenitors

Pre-myelinating oligodendrocyte progenitors (preOLs), which peak in the white matter between 23 weeks' gestation and 32 weeks' gestation, are the primary cellular target in periventricular white matter injury (PWMI). Pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes are more susceptible than more mature cells to oxidative stress, which results from hypoxic-ischemic insults as well as infection/inflammation.¹⁻³ The risk of PWMI declines with the differentiation of preOLs into immature OLs starting at 30 to 32 weeks' postconceptional age and corresponds to the initiation of myelination of human periventricular white matter.

such as T1- and T2-weighed imaging and advanced sequences such as diffusion-weighed imaging and diffusion tensor imaging should be used.

## 51. E. The Sarnat classification scale codifies the neurological examination of a neonate into 6 domains.

The Sarnat score is used in clinical practice to codify the neurological examination and assess the degree of encephalopathy in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. It was originally published in 1976 by Sarnat and Sarnat¹ and later modified to include scoring on a scale from 1 to 3 in 6 domains of the neurological examination.² The 6 domains included in the modified Sarnat score include the following:

- Level of consciousness
- Activity
- Posture
- Tone
- Primitive reflexes
- Autonomic dysfunction of the pupils, heart rate, and respirations

In most studies, abnormalities in 3 of the 6 domains define moderate to severe encephalopathy.

## 52. E. Negative burst suppression

Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is used for continuous and noninvasive bedside monitoring of brain activity in sick neonates. The interpretation of the aEEG background activity is an important step when assessing the severity of encephalopathy in a newborn with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy such as the newborn described in the vignette. Several classification systems have been developed for the classification of aEEG background patterns.

Al Naqeeb and colleagues¹ developed a basic classification system based on voltage assessment as follows:

- Normal: lower margin above 5 μV and upper margin above 10 μV
- Moderately abnormal: lower margin below 5 μV and upper margin above 10 μV
- Suppressed: lower margin below 5 μV and upper margin below 10 μV

Hellström-Westas and colleagues² developed a classification system that includes 5 aEEG background patterns as follows:

- Continuous activity: lower amplitude of 5 to 7 μV (up to 10 μV); maximum amplitude of 10 to 25 μV (up to 50 μV)
- Discontinuous activity: variable lower border variable (&lt;5 μV with maximum amplitude &gt;10 μV), leading to a wider bandwidth
- Burst suppression: discontinuous background with minimum amplitude without variability (0–2 μV) and bursts with amplitude &gt;25 μV. Two types of burst suppression pattern are distinguished: positive burst suppression (≥100 bursts per hour) and negative burst suppression (&lt;100 bursts per hour)
- Low-voltage pattern: continuous background pattern of very low amplitude of about 5 μV
- Flat or isoelectric tracing: extremely low background amplitude (significantly below 5 μV)

Neurology

53. C. According to the meta-analysis, there appears to be a larger degree of improvement in outcomes for neonates who have moderate encephalopathy compared to that seen for neonates who have severe encephalopathy.

Therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has been shown to be neuroprotective in multiple randomized trials.¹,² Eligibility criteria, while slightly different between the trials, all included a 2-step process for inclusion.

- Biological evidence of a hypoxic-ischemic event, including metabolic acidosis at birth, low 10-minute Apgar score, or continued need for resuscitation at 10 minutes after birth
- Evidence of moderate or severe encephalopathy based on neurological examination

Methods to provide therapeutic hypothermia include the following:

- Whole-body cooling with goal core temperature of 33°C to 34°C
- Selective head cooling with mild systemic cooling with goal core temperature of 34°C to 35°C

In all trials, therapeutic hypothermia was maintained for 72 hours, followed by a slow rewarming phase, with a rewarming rate no faster than 0.5°C per hour.²

Several meta-analyses found that therapeutic hypothermia is associated with improvement in death or major neurodevelopmental disability, mortality, and major neurodevelopmental disability in survivors at 18 to 24 months with a number needed to treat to prevent one death or major disability between 5 and 7.¹,³ While outcomes appear to be improved regardless of the severity of encephalopathy, the degree of neuroprotection is greater in neonates with moderate encephalopathy compared to those with severe encephalopathy.³

## 54. C. Meconium drug screening

Toxicology screening is an important aspect of the treatment of newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Urine drug screening of neonates has limited utility because it will detect only drugs recently used or abused by the mother, resulting in a high false-negative rate. The use of meconium and neonatal hair for drug testing was found to be more sensitive for the detection of opioid and cocaine exposure when compared with a structured maternal interview. While neonatal hair analysis had a sensitivity of 100% for cocaine and 80% for opiate detection, it also had a high false-positive rate for cocaine (13%) and for opiate (20%). In contrast, meconium drug screening had a sensitivity of 87% for cocaine and 77% for opiate detection and no false-positive results for cocaine exposure. In this study, a structured maternal interview was found to have a low sensitivity for the detection of opioid and cocaine exposure.

## 55. E. The finding of WMA at term equivalent postmenstrual age has been associated with motor, cognitive, language, and executive function delays.

White matter abnormalities (WMA) are the most common cause of brain injury in preterm neonates. They are best assessed using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the pattern of WMA includes parenchymal lesions, punctate hyperintensities, and diffuse excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI). Of note, assessment of gray matter injury is typically performed at the same time, as it is commonly associated with WMA.

Parenchymal lesions identified at term equivalent postmenstrual age (TEA) include the following:

- Cystic or diffuse periventricular white matter injury (or periventricular leukomalacia)
- Parenchymal hemorrhage
- Infarction
- White matter loss

The presence of parenchymal lesions on brain MRI at term equivalent age is predictive of cerebral palsy at 18 to 21 months with sensitivities between 71% and 100%. The sensitivity remains good at 31 months (87%).

Answers

Punctate white matter hyperintensities are also predictive of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm neonates in a manner that is dependent on

- The number of lesions. The presence of 6 or more lesions is strongly associated with abnormal motor development.³
- The location of the lesions. Lesions in the corona that radiate above the posterior limb of the internal capsule, but not those anterior or posterior, are highly specific for predicting motor disability at 3 to 5 years.⁴
- The timing of the lesions. Punctate hyperintensities identified prior to TEA are not predictive of long-term outcomes.⁵

The presence of DEHSI on brain MRI should be interpreted with caution, particularly when imaged on a 3 Tesla scanner, as this finding may be transient and to date no consistent association with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome has been identified.⁶

Several standardized scoring systems have been developed to quantify the degree of white matter injury identified on brain MRI using conventional magnetic resonance sequences in preterm neonates.⁷,⁸

Heel sticks are one of the most common procedures performed in neonates and have been shown to be more painful than venipunctures.¹ The use of local anesthetics such as EMLA (2.5% lidocaine, 2.5% prilocaine mixture) has not been shown to decrease pain scores secondary to heel lancing.² Nonpharmacological interventions such as nonnutritive sucking, swaddling/facilitated tucking, skin-to-skin care, and rocking/holding have been shown to be helpful in decreasing the newborn's response to acute procedural pain. The use of oral sucrose has also been shown to reduce pain behaviors in preterm and term neonates.³

Multiple biomarkers of preterm brain injury have been studied, including protein S100β. This protein is primarily produced by astrocytes and is rapidly released into the bloodstream with blood-brain barrier disruptions.¹ Reference ranges for protein S100β are available for preterm and term neonates. Protein S100β can be measured in many biological fluids including urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, amniotic fluid, and human milk.²

In preterm neonates, elevated S100β levels in the urine are associated with a higher risk of mortality.³ Further, urine S100β concentration at birth has been shown to be higher in preterm neonates who go on to develop an intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), with the highest concentration observed in neonates who later develop severe IVH.⁴

The early recognition of fetal alcohol syndrome is important to improve the long-term outcomes of children with gestational alcohol exposure. In the neonatal period, newborns affected by fetal alcohol syndrome may present with a history of intrauterine growth restriction and a small-for-gestational age birth weight, microcephaly, and the following characteristic facial dysmorphic features:

- Short palpebral fissures
- Smooth philtrum
- Thin vermillion border of the upper lip¹⁻³

## 59. D. The neuroprotective mechanism of EPO may result from the prevention of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation that can occur after hypoxic-ischemic injury.

Erythropoietin (EPO), an endogenous glycoprotein induced by hypoxia hematopoiesis, has been shown to be neuroprotective.¹⁻⁴ The activation of neuronal EPO receptors is neuroprotective via several mechanisms including the following:

- Prevention of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation secondary to hypoxia-ischemia
- Increases expression of antiapoptotic proteins
- Decreased excitotoxicity
- Decreasing apoptosis
- Decreased peroxynitrite production and oxidative stress
- Decreased inflammatory cytokines⁴,⁵

There are a high number of neuronal EPO receptors in the developing human brain.⁶ Recombinant EPO administered systematically has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier after hypoxia-ischemia.⁷

## 60. A. A key component of NIDCAP is that findings that occur through observation of the neonate are discussed with the parents and staff, before recommendations are determined.

The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) is a family-centered program that¹

- Is implemented from birth
- Encompasses a system's approach to care incorporating the neonate, the family, and the environment of care perspectives

---

<!-- Page 560 -->

Answers

- Assesses the needs of the neonate based on the observation of behavioral cues
- Makes decisions on adjustments to care based on these observations and after discussion with staff and family

There are multiple training centers worldwide, with Boston being the first training center in 1982.

Two meta-analyses demonstrated short-term benefits of the NIDCAP program but included heterogeneous studies of small sizes.²,³ The NIDCAP program has also been shown to have long-term benefits on neonate behavior in 2 studies with follow-up at 5.5 and 8 years.⁴,⁵ In a meta-analyses, Ohlsson and Jacobs found no evidence that NIDCAP improves short-term medical outcomes or long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.⁶ A Cochrane review concluded that NIDCAP could not be recommended until evidence of more consistent effects on short- and long-term outcomes is available.²

## 61. A. Abnormal findings on MRI, including corticospinal tract injury, are likely to be more commonly seen in patients who were hypoglycemic during the first 24 hours.

Early hypoglycemia in newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a risk factor for seizures and abnormal encephalopathy score. In addition, it is associated with a higher risk of corticospinal tract injury revealed on brain magnetic resonance imaging performed between 2 days and 5 days after birth. At 1 year of age, children with early hypoglycemia also have a 5-fold increase of having a low neuromotor function score.¹

## 62. E. The NICHD whole-body cooling trial patients have been assessed at 6 to 7 years of age, and the direction of the effect favors the hypothermia group for the primary outcome of death or IQ less than 70.

Therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has been shown to be neuroprotective at 18 to 21 months in multiple randomized trials. Several meta-analyses of these trials found that therapeutic hypothermia is associated with improvement in death or major neurodevelopmental disability, mortality, and major neurodevelopmental disability in survivors at 18 to 24 months with a number needed to treat to prevent one death or major disability between 5 and 7.¹⁻³

Longer-term outcome data at early school age are now also available from the CoolCap and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) whole-body cooling trials.

In the CoolCap trial, 45.9% of the neonates enrolled in the trial were evaluated at 7 to 8 years of age. Results from this trial indirectly supported a sustained effect of therapeutic hypothermia on outcomes with a strong correlation between outcomes at 18 months and 7 to 8 years.⁴

The follow-up rate at 6 to 7 years was 91% in the NICHD whole-body cooling trial. In this trial, while the primary outcome of death or IQ less than 70 decreased from 62% in the control group to 47% in the therapeutic hypothermia group, it did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant decrease in the secondary outcome of death from 44% to 28% (P = .04) in the control group and the therapeutic hypothermia group, respectively. In this trial, a low 10-minute Apgar score (&lt;3) was associated with increased risk of death or severe disability (76%, 82%, and 80% for Apgar score of 0, 1, or 2 at 10 minutes, respectively). This association between a low 10-minute Apgar score and outcome persisted at the 6- to 7-year follow-up.⁵

## 63. A. Gastrointestinal dysfunction can be seen along the entire gastrointestinal tract, as smooth and skeletal muscle may be involved.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CTG repeats in the noncoding region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene on chromosome 19. It is classified as congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD) and childhood myotonic dystrophy (ChMD).

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a multisystem disorder that can affect the respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, endocrine, ocular, and auditory systems as follows:

- Patients with CMD can present with respiratory distress at birth secondary to muscle weakness. They are also at increased risk of aspiration and pneumonia. Other respiratory dysfunction affecting patients with DM1 include orthopnea, dyspnea, snoring, and daytime sleepiness.
- Arrhythmias can occur and are the leading cause of death in adulthood. This is an uncommon complication in childhood.
- Gastrointestinal dysfunction can be seen along the entire gastrointestinal tract. This may include poor oral skills and need for gastrostomy tube in the neonatal period, risk of aspiration, abdominal discomfort, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence.
- Newborns with CMD are typically hypotonic at birth. Weakness is more common in those who have CMD than those who have ChMD. Hypotonia and weakness improve with time such that most patients attain independent ambulation. Dysphagia, dysarthria, ptosis, and decreased facial expression can be long-term problems due to persistent jaw and facial muscle weakness.
- Patients with DM1 should be monitored for the development of hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, estradiol insufficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and insulin resistance. These typically develop in adulthood.
- Ophthalmologic complications can occur and include ptosis, weakness of eyelid closure, strabismus, and cataract (in adults).
- Otitis infections are frequent during infancy, and the need for surgical intervention is common.

## 64. B. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials showed that therapeutic hypothermia is associated with improvement in the combined outcome of death or major neurodevelopmental disability, mortality, major neurodevelopmental disability in survivors, and cerebral palsy.

Multiple large randomized trials have investigated the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on neurodevelopmental outcomes after neonatal moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Trial results were consistently in favor of therapeutic hypothermia, and, importantly, none of the trials showed that patients who received hypothermia were more likely to have severe disability.

Meta-analyses of these trials have shown that therapeutic hypothermia is associated with improvement in the following outcomes at 18 to 24 months:

- Death or major neurodevelopmental disability
- Mortality
- Major neurodevelopmental disability in survivors

The number needed to treat to prevent 1 death or major disability is between 5 and 7. $^{1,2}$

School-age outcomes, available from some of the larger trials, support a strong correlation between 18 to 24 months and 6 to 8 years outcomes. $^{3}$

## 65. B. Dejerine-Sottas disease

Dejerine-Sottas disease is a severe hereditary motor and sensory demyelinating neuropathy that is characterized by the following:

- Presentation before age 2 with hypotonia or delayed motor development. Affected patients can present in the neonatal period with hypotonia, arthrogryposis, foot deformities, and respiratory distress often requiring mechanical ventilation support. In addition, there may be a prenatal history of decreased fetal movements, intrauterine growth restriction, and polyhydramnios.¹
- Areflexia on neurological examination.
- Markedly decreased nerve conduction velocity (&lt;12 m/s).
- Significant decrease in myelinated fiber density, thin myelin sheaths, and onion bulb formation on nerve biopsy. This distinguishes Dejerine-Sottas disease from congenital hypo-myelinating neuropathy where complete absence of peripheral nerve myelin is observed along with absence of myelin degeneration evidence such as onion bulb formation.²

Along with congenital hypo-myelinating neuropathy, Dejerine-Sottas disease is currently thought to be part of a broader disease spectrum of congenital myelinopathies. The most common mutations identified in these patients are myelin protein zero, peripheral myelin protein 22, and early growth response 2 mutations.³⁻⁸

## 66. D. Seizures usually have an appearance of a gradual buildup and decline in frequency and an amplitude that includes repetitive spikes, sharp waves, or a single sinusoidal pattern that lasts 5 to 10 seconds.

Seizures on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) will appear as simultaneous and rapid increases in minimal and maximal amplitudes often preceded by a short period of depressed activity. Seizures detected on aEEG should always be confirmed with a conventional electroencephalogram (EEG). Features characteristic of seizure activity on EEG include the following:

- Gradual buildup and decline in frequency and amplitude
- Presence of repetitive spikes, sharp waves, or a single sinusoidal pattern that lasts 5 to 10 seconds¹

Most neonatal seizures (78%) localize to the centrotemporal area and, therefore, can be detected by aEEG. Seizures that are brief (&lt;30 seconds) are not detected by aEEG.²,³ Finally, it is important to distinguish seizures from artefacts using time-frequency analysis and video recording.⁴,⁵

67. A. As one-third of patients may develop latex allergy, precaution to use non-latex gloves should be taken.

Myelomeningocele are neural tube defects that occur with an incidence of about 2.0 per 1,000 births.¹ The care of newborns with myelomeningocele includes defect closure, surveillance and treatment of hydrocephalus, and coordinated, long-term multidisciplinary care.

Defect closure may occur prenatally in some cases or postnatally. Postnatal closure should occur within 72 hours after birth. Antibiotics are recommended preoperatively to prevent infections. Postoperatively, the development of rapidly progressive hydrocephalus is indicated for 3 to 10 days depending on the level of concern. Overall, 56% to 86% of neonates with myelomeningocele will eventually require a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt.²,³ In some patients, placement of a VP shunt at the same time as the myelomeningocele repair may be indicated.³ When caring for these patients, it is important to use non-latex gloves, as 33% of patients with myelomeningocele develop a latex allergy.⁴ Of note, the preterm delivery of newborns with myelomeningocele to avoid prolonged amniotic fluid exposure has not been shown to consistently improve functional outcomes.

68. C. Diffusion tensor imaging

Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is the most common form of brain injury and cause of neurodevelopmental impairments in neonates born preterm. There are 2 forms of PVL, cystic and diffuse.

- Cystic PVL (cPVL) is characterized by the presence of focal cystic necrotic lesions in the periventricular white matter and can easily be identified on cranial ultrasound. The incidence of cPVL has been decreasing over the past several years and occurs among less than 5% of preterm neonates born at less than 32 weeks’ gestational age.¹
- Diffuse PVL represents the most common form of brain injury observed in neonates born preterm. Studies indicate that diffuse PVL occurs in 17% to 25% of neonates born at less than 32 weeks’ gestational age when imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term corrected age.¹,² Diffuse PVL is not reliably detected on cranial ultrasound. Brain MRI, particularly T2-weighed imaging, is the imaging technique of choice for the identification of diffuse PVL. Advanced MRI sequences, such as diffusion tension imaging, have been shown to be particularly sensitive in the detection of diffuse PVL.³,⁴ However, caution should be exercised when only diffuse excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI) is seen on brain image (particularly when imaged on a 3 Tesla scanner), as this finding may be transient and to date no association with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome has been identified.⁵

Cerebellar hemorrhages (CBHs) are now recognized as an important pattern of brain injury in preterm neonates. It is best identified by brain magnetic resonance imaging, as cranial ultrasonography, even when adding the posterior fossa and mastoid views, has been shown to underestimate the presence of CBH.¹

Cerebellar injury is associated with neurodevelopmental impairments in the motor, cognitive, and behavioral domains.²,³ Limperopoulos and colleagues found that preterm neonates with isolated CBH on term equivalent age had neurodevelopmental impairments in 66% of cases compared with 5% in age-matched control participants. Those included (isolated CBH vs controls).³

## 70. B. Due to the complex factors that affect pharmacokinetics in a patient with ECMO, dosing of analgesic and sedative drugs in this patient may be difficult to predict.

Sedation and analgesia is typically required during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to prevent unintentional decannulation. In general, higher doses of pain and sedation medications are required in neonates receiving ECMO. Multiple factors influence drug pharmacokinetics during ECMO such that predicting appropriate dosing is challenging.

Some factors result in need to decrease the drug doses including

- Increased volume of distribution because of the ECMO circuit
- Binding/sequestration of drugs in the circuit (up to 40% for lorazepam and up to 50% for morphine)¹
- Hemofiltration of small molecules

Others result in need to decrease drug doses.²

- Decreased drug clearance due to renal and hepatic injury
- Immature organ function in neonates
- Active drug metabolites

While the rates of recovery have been historically reported to be high (90%), recent systematic reviews indicate that residual deficits occur in 20% to 30% of patients,¹,² with lower lesions being more likely to result in long-term impairment than upper lesions (66% vs 21%).¹

The recovery of biceps function within the first month after birth predicts full recovery of function by age 2. However, if the recovery in biceps function is delayed to 2 to 3 months after birth, full recovery is much less likely. Recovery of biceps function beyond 3 months is associated with long-term deficits.³

## 72. A. Activin receptors are highly expressed in neuronal cells, and preterm newborns with high serum activin A levels have higher risk of developing IVH.

Several biomarkers of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) have been studied including

- Protein S100β, a protein produced by astrocytes and rapidly released into the blood after blood-brain barrier disruptions. Urine and blood concentrations of protein S100β are elevated at birth in infants who later develop IVH, with the levels correlating to the degree of injury.¹

Neurology

- Activin, a trophic factor highly expressed in neurons. Activin levels are elevated shortly after birth in neonates who develop IVH.²
- Erythropoietin (EPO). In a prospective study, elevated cord EPO levels were shown to be predictive of the development of IVH, even after correcting for gestational age.³
- Chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18). Low cord levels of CCL18 have been associated with increased risk of IVH as well as cerebral palsy.⁴
- Brain type creatine phosphokinase (CPK-BB). Early increase in CPK-BB concentration has been shown to be associated with IVH.⁵
- Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In asymptomatic pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery, elevated IL-6 and CRP levels were associated with increased IVH risk in their preterm newborn.⁶

## 73. A. Allopurinol is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, which is a source of superoxide.

Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, has been shown to be neuroprotective in animal studies.¹⁻³ It has also been shown to decrease death or severe disability in one randomized controlled trial of 60 neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.⁴ Current interest has been focused on the prenatal use of allopurinol. Preclinical data indicate that maternal treatment with allopurinol results in decreased superoxide production and hippocampal injury in fetal lambs exposed to intermittent cord occlusion.¹,⁵ Data in humans are somewhat limited, with one randomized controlled trial demonstrating decreased S100β levels in neonates born to mothers treated with allopurinol.⁶ A larger trial of prenatal allopurinol administration did not show a decrease in neuronal damage markers, with potential benefit restricted to girls.⁷ A 5-year follow-up study did not demonstrate a benefit of prenatal allopurinol administration on long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes.⁸

## 74. B. IBAIP uses observations of the infant's behavioral interactions with parents after discharge from the nursery.

Developmental care is centered on individualized care based on infant behavior and cues, and multiple programs have been developed to better assess and understand the competencies of an individual infant. These programs encompass preparation for discharge and transition to home.

Answers

The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) is a family-centered program implemented from birth that assesses the needs of the newborn based on the observation of behavioral cues prior to, during, and after interventions. Decisions on adjustments to care are based on these observations and after discussion with staff and family. The program supports parents' involvement and facilitates discharge preparation.¹

The Infant Behavioral Assessment and Intervention Program (IBAIP) is a program based on the same theory as NIDCAP but, in addition, includes 6 to 8 home visits after neonatal intensive care unit discharge. In the home setting, IBAIP professionals can support families in understanding how their infant handles environmental information and assist parents in making adjustments to promote neurobehavioral organization and self-regulatory competence.²

The Mother-Infant Transaction Program (MITP) is also designed to support parents in interpreting behavioral cues in their infant and to respond appropriately. It is implemented 1 week before discharge and continues for 3 months after discharge with 4 home visits.³

## 75. B. Care in the neonatal intensive care unit for more than 5 days, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, craniofacial anomalies, assisted ventilation, and hyperbilirubinemia requiring exchange transfusion are some factors that increase risk of hearing loss.

Hearing impairment occurs in 2% to 4% of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for more than 5 days (a 10-fold increased risk).¹,²

Risk factors for hearing impairment include very low birth weight, NICU stay greater than 5 days, ototoxic medications, history of exchange transfusion, history of TORCH infection, history of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, craniofacial anomalies, culture-positive meningitis, and congenital syndromes associated with hearing loss. On average, significant hearing loss is diagnosed at age 14 months.¹ Early identification and treatment is key to improving outcomes.¹⁻⁴ Despite that, only about 62% of neonates with hearing loss are enrolled in early intervention.³

## 76. D. Renal cysts

Zellweger syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder due to a mutation in one of the peroxyn (PEX) genes resulting in the intracellular accumulation of very long chain fatty acids. It represents a severe form of peroxisome biogenesis disorders that also include adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata.¹ Patients affected by Zellweger syndrome typically present in the neonatal period with the following:

- Characteristic facial features (high forehead, large fontanelles with wide sutures, epicanthus, shallow orbital bridge, and anteverted nares)
- Abnormal retinal pigmentation
- Marked hypotonia
- Poor feeding
- Hepatomegaly and hepatic dysfunction
- Renal cysts
- Shortened proximal limbs
- Chondrodysplasia punctata

The presence of cortical malformations of the peri-sylvian and peri-rolandic regions, hypomyelination, and subependymal germinolytic cysts on brain image are highly suggestive of Zellweger syndrome.

77. E. There is a decrease of oxygen and glucose in proportion to the degree of asphyxia, which is associated with a switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.

In the neonatal period, the brain utilizes 70% or more of the glucose produced by the liver. Exposure to hypoxic-ischemic stress leads to a switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism and in turn decreases glucose delivery in proportion to the degree of asphyxia. Because of the limited energy stores in neonates as well as an immature counter-regulatory response, this results in hypoglycemia.

Studies indicate that both hypoglycemia (particularly early after the insult) and hyperglycemia are associated with poor outcomes in newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). However, there are no randomized clinical trials to guide clinicians as to what the optimal glucose level target should be in newborns affected by HIE.¹⁻⁴

- Sepsis is associated with prevalent burst suppression patterns but not with altered aEEG maturation.¹
- Neonates with higher severity of illness score and low blood pressure have more suppressed aEEG background patterns.²
- Surfactant administration results in temporary (about 1 hour) suppression of brain activity.³
- Neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have a wider span voltage and higher lower border voltage during active sleep as well as decreased amount of quiet sleep per hour.⁴

Therapeutic hypothermia for the treatment of moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy occurs in 4 distinct phases.¹,²

<!-- Page 568 -->

Answers

1. An induction phase during which the core temperature is rapidly decreased to the goal temperature.
2. A maintenance phase during which core temperature is tightly maintained between 33°C to 34°C (whole-body cooling) and 34°C to 35°C (selective head cooling) for a duration of 72 hours. The use of sedation during cooling should be strongly considered, particularly in infants with agitation or excessive shivering, as this may lead to increased metabolic demand.
3. A rewarming phase during which the core temperature is slowly increased. Rewarming rates of 0.5°C or less per hour are recommended to avoid temperature overshoot and rebound seizures. During the rewarming phase, neonates should be monitored for hypotension.
4. A normothermia phase to prevent hyperthermia.

## 81. A. Children in a comprehensive early behavioral intervention program have shown improvements in IQ, adaptive skills, and diagnostic status.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is more common in children born preterm.¹ In a prospective study with rigorous diagnosis of ASD, low birth weight infants (&lt;2,000 g) were found to have prevalence of ASD of 5%, 3 times that of the general population.²

In children younger than 3 years at the time of diagnosis, services are available through the state early intervention system. Early developmental behavioral interventions that are family centered and include parent training, behavioral therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy have been shown to result in improvements in IQ, adaptive skills, and diagnostic status after 2 years.³ All toddlers with ASD improve with early intervention, with the highest benefits seen in those with higher cognitive scores pre-intervention.⁴

## 82. B. aEEG uses single EEG channels to show EEG amplitude as a compressed trend.

The amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is generated from the raw EEG signal using the following steps:

- The signal is amplified.
- A narrow filter (&lt;2 Hz and &gt;15 Hz) is applied. This greatly minimizes artefacts including muscle activity, and environmental electrical interference.
- The signal is rectified (negative voltages are converted to positive values; peak-to-peak amplitudes are measured and weighed toward alpha frequencies).
- The signal is smoothed, plotted on a semilogarithmic scale to emphasize lower voltage activity, and displayed on a logarithmic scale between 10 and 100 μV.
- Finally, the signal is viewed in a highly compressed timescale (6 cm/h), which allows for optimal assessment of trends in cerebral activity.¹,²

The most commonly used electrode placements include central (C3–C4), central-parietal (C3–P3 and C4–P4), and parietal (P3–P4) derivations. Placement of electrodes in the frontal region should be avoided because of decreased sensitivity to seizure detection.³

Neurology

83. B. The finding of these lesions at term postmenstrual gestation (such as in this infant) is more worrisome than if it was found prior to term postmenstrual age, because of the associated risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome.

Punctate white matter hyperintensities are one of the patterns of white matter abnormalities that can be identified on brain magnetic resonance imaging in preterm infants. These lesions are predictive of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes depending on the number, location, and timing of lesions. Studies indicate that the presence of 6 or more lesions is strongly associated with abnormal motor development.¹ The location of the lesions is also very important to consider, with lesions in the corona radiate above the posterior limb of the internal capsule being highly specific of motor disability at 3 to 5 years.² Finally, punctate hyperintensities identified prior to term equivalent postmenstrual age have not been shown to be predictive of long-term outcomes.³

86. C. Lack of a normal aEEG background, abnormal neurological examination finding, and MRI findings consistent with HIE.

A hypoxic-ischemic insult may be suspected in children with neonatal encephalopathy if

- There is a perinatal history consistent with hypoxia-ischemia (ie, placental abruption, uterine rupture, prolonged fetal bradycardia).
- A metabolic acidosis is present in cord blood or early baby blood gas assessments.

A brain magnetic resonance imaging study with a pattern of injury consistent with a hypoxic-ischemic insult confirms the diagnosis.

In neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, the following findings are helpful to consider when assessing the risk of adverse long-term outcomes:

- A 10-minute Apgar score less than 3 is associated with a high risk of early neonatal death with an adjusted relative risk of 359·4 (95% CI, 277·3–465·9).¹
- A persistently abnormal neurological examination finding beyond 72 hours after birth is associated with increased risk of death or disability with an adjusted odds ratio of 18.61 (95% CI, 5.37–64.49) compared with neonates who improved in fewer than 24 hours after birth.²
- A persistently abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) background beyond 72 hours after birth. In contrast, a very abnormal aEEG during the first 24 to 48 hours that normalizes after 48 hours is a good prognostic sign.³

# 87. C. Greater concentration of chloride in the neuron

Seizures are common in the neonatal period because of the excitation/inhibition imbalance characteristic of the newborn brain, largely due to delay in the maturation of inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. In the mature brain, GABA receptor activation results in a net influx of chloride into the cell, resulting in decreased cellular membrane resting potential and thereby inhibition of action potentials. In contrast, the immature brain is characterized by higher intraneuronal chloride concentration; therefore, GABA receptor-mediated inhibition is diminished or may even have a net excitatory effect. This developmental asynchrony in excitatory and inhibitory systems in the brain may explain why neonatal seizures have an incomplete response to medications that act via GABAergic mechanisms such as phenobarbital and benzodiazepines.¹,²

# 88. B. Germinal matrix vulnerability

Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common complication of preterm birth, and severe IVH has been shown to adversely affect the outcomes of preterm neonates.

In preterm neonates, IVH originates in the germinal matrix, a highly vascular structure located in the caudothalamic groove and overlying the caudate nucleus. The germinal matrix is a site of active cellular production. Early in pregnancy, neurons are produced and migrate to the cortex. Between 23 and 32 weeks’ gestation, glial cells are produced in the germinal matrix. As the need for cellular production decreases with advancing gestation, the germinal matrix involutes, with almost complete involution by 36 weeks’ gestation.

The development of IVH is multifactorial and involves anatomical as well as physiological factors. First, the germinal matrix lies within an arterial end zone and is directly connected to the deep galenic venous system. In addition to the tenuous capillary integrity and vulnerability to hypoxia-ischemia, extravascular factors such as poor vascular support and increased fibrinolytic activity further increase the risk of bleeding. Physiological instability after birth and in the setting of limited ability to autoregulate cerebral blood flow further compounds the problem.¹,²

Nonpharmacological measures and family-focused care are the cornerstone of therapy for neonates affected by neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). For newborns with opioid withdrawal who require pharmacological intervention, treatment with an opioid (most commonly morphine or methadone) is the recommended first-line treatment of choice.¹⁻³ In a Cochrane review, the use of opioid as first-line pharmacological therapy for newborns with NAS due to opioid withdrawal was associated with improved resolution of symptoms and decreased likelihood of needing a second agent compared with phenobarbitone or diazepam.⁴

# 90. A. Congenital disorder of glycosylation

Congenital disorders of glycosylation are autosomal recessive disorders secondary to abnormal synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides are critical for synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids.

Affected neonates may present with microcephaly and hypotonia. Physical examination may reveal the following:

- Abnormal distribution of fat (most prominently in the suprapubic, iliac, and buttock regions)
- Inverted nipples
- Strabismus

Cardiomyopathy, protein-losing enteropathy, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, and seizures may also occur. Brain imaging, if performed, may demonstrate progressive atrophy.¹

# 91. B. Corticospinal pathway

Prenatal ultrasonographic techniques are used to document neural development (normal and abnormal) or damage. Newer techniques, such as 3- and 4-dimensional ultrasonography, can allow further exploration of the neuromaturation of the fetus. Using these techniques, the presence of active abduction of the thumb indicates intact upper motor control and corticospinal pathways. In contrast, fetuses with severe brain damage cannot open their hands spontaneously, and active abduction of the thumb is not seen.¹

# 92. E. 2 to 4 weeks of age

Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is the most common form of brain injury and cause of neurodevelopmental impairments in neonates born preterm. There are 2 forms of PVL.

- Cystic PVL (cPVL) is characterized by the presence of focal cystic necrotic lesions in the periventricular white matter and can easily be identified on cranial ultrasound, typically at 2 to 4 weeks of age. The incidence of cPVL has been decreasing over the past several years and occurs among fewer than 5% of neonates born at less than 32 weeks' gestational age.¹
- Diffuse PVL represents the most common form of brain injury observed in neonates born preterm. Studies indicate that diffuse PVL occurs in 17% to 25% of neonates born at less than 32 weeks' gestational age when imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term corrected age.¹² Diffuse PVL is not reliably detected on cranial ultrasound, and brain MRI, particularly T2-weighed imaging, is the imaging technique of choice for the identification of diffuse PVL.³

# 93. D. Melatonin has been shown to reduce the extent of neutrophil migration in animal models of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.

Melatonin is a hormone with multiple cellular effects, some of which target known mechanisms of hypoxia-ischemia-induced brain injury. These effects include

- Decreased free radical injury via scavenging hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite, and reducing superoxide production.¹²
- Anti-inflammatory activity with decreased neutrophil migration, decreased macrophage-activated microglia activation, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production such as interleukin 2 and interleukin 6.³⁴

In newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, melatonin administration within 6 hours after birth decreased levels of malonaldehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation.⁵

# 94. B. Cervical nerve root 6

Perinatal brachial plexus palsy (PBPP) is classified according to the location of the nerve injury as follows:

- Upper lesion (C5, C6, and ±C7), characterized by poor shoulder function and variable hand function. Erb palsy is an upper trunk lesion (C5 and C6) resulting in the "waiter's tip" posture, with shoulder adduction and internal rotation, elbow extension, forearm pronation, and wrist flexion.
- Lower lesion (C8 and T1), characterized by good shoulder function and poor hand function. Klumpke palsy is a lower trunk lesion (C8 and T1) affecting wrist and finger flexors as well as intrinsic hand muscles. Horner syndrome occurs alongside lower lesions when the sympathetic fibers of T1 are injured.
- Total lesion (C5-T1), characterized by poor function in the entire arm and accounting for 18% of all PBPP cases. $^{1,2}$

# 95. E. EDS type VII (arthrochalasis)

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) represents a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by joint laxity, skin abnormalities, and skeletal changes, as well as cardiovascular and ophthalmologic abnormalities. Among EDS, types VIIA and VIIB (arthrochalasis) are the most likely to be recognized in the newborn period.

Affected newborns may present with

- Bilateral hip dislocations
- Congenital patellar dislocations with hyperextension of the knees
- Hypotonia secondary to excessive joint laxity

A history of breech in presentation may also be present.

EDS types VIIA and VIIB are autosomal dominant disorders caused by mutations in exon 6 of the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. $^{1}$

# 96. C. Fatty acid ethyl ester

The early recognition of fetal alcohol syndrome is important to improve the long-term outcomes of children with gestational alcohol exposure. However, because of maternal underreporting, affected children may have significant delays in diagnosis. As such, methods to detect fetal alcohol exposure are actively being investigated. Among those, the most promising is the detection of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). While they are present in the meconium of neonates born to mothers who abstain or mothers with poorly controlled diabetes and glycosuria, FAEEs are more prevalent among the meconium of neonates born to mothers with problematic drinking. In addition, a FAEE value greater 600 ng has a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98.4% for exogenous alcohol exposure in utero. $^{1-3}$

## 97. B. Chromatin aggregation

Following a hypoxic-ischemic insult, both necrotic and apoptotic cell death occur.

Necrotic cell death is characterized by

- Passive cell swelling
- Rapid energy loss with subsequent disruption of internal homeostasis and lysis of the nucleus, organelles, and plasma cell membranes
- Release of intracellular components with resultant local inflammatory response

Apoptotic (programmed) cell death occurs in the days to weeks following the hypoxic-ischemic insult. It is characterized by $^{1,2}$

- Cell shrinkage
- Coarse chromatin aggregation and nuclear DNA fragmentation
- Nuclear pyknosis
- Extrusion of membrane bound cytoplasmic fragments (or apoptotic bodies)

## 98. A. The Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment program, based on the theory of self-regulation and control, is designed to help parents interpret their babies and has been shown to reduce length of stay.

Developmentally supportive interventions and family-centered care are important aspects in the care of preterm neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Developmental care is centered on individualized care based on newborn behavior and cues, and multiple programs incorporating these concepts have been developed.

The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) is a family-centered program that is implemented from birth and assesses the needs of the newborn based on the observation of behavioral cues prior to, during, and after interventions. Decisions on adjustments to care are based on these observations and after discussion with staff and family. Nurseries can obtain a NIDCAP certification after staff training and a standardized examination process. $^{1}$

The Infant Behavioral Assessment and Intervention Program (IBAIP) is a program based on the same theory as NIDCAP but, in addition, includes 6 to 8 home visits after NICU discharge. In the home setting, IBAIP providers can support families in understanding how their infant handles environmental information and assist parents in making adjustments to promote neurobehavioral organization and self-regulatory competence. $^{2}$

The Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment (COPE) program is based on the theory of self-regulation and control. It utilizes standardized information material designed to help parents learn about infant behavior, respond in a supportive manner, and facilitate their infant's development. The COPE program has been shown to reduce length of stay. $^{3}$

Couplet care is based on the concept coupling the care of the baby with that of the postpartum mother.

## 100. C. Children who do not require a shunt as infants are more likely to have higher achievement in education than those children who had shunts, with children who require shunt revision more likely to have lower achievement.

Most neonates with myelomeningocele survive and about 56% to 86% will require ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.¹,² Mortality after initial repair is most commonly secondary to Arnold-Chiari malformation type II progression and shunt malfunction. Shunt malfunction is a common problem within the first year and is important to recognize in a timely fashion. Patients may present with headache, vomiting, and lethargy or with subtler signs such as deteriorating school performance, worsening urological function, or worsening lower extremity function.³ Brain imaging is not always helpful, emphasizing the need for a high index of suspicion for shunt malfunction diagnosis in patients with a myelomeningocele.

The long-term outcomes of patients with myelomeningoceles are as follows:

- 47% of patients are able to ambulate in the community.
- 80% of patients achieve social urinary continence, with 85% requiring intermittent catheterization.
- Of men, 12% to 75% have erectile dysfunction.
- Of patients, 70% to 75% have a normal IQ.
- 60% of patients have a learning disability.

Patients who do not need a shunt are more likely to have higher achievement in education than those children who had shunts, particularly those who required shunt revisions.¹,⁴

## 101. D. The degree of placental transfer for SSRIs is dependent on the molecular weight, plasma protein binding, and pharmacokinetics of the medication.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase serotonin (5-HT) levels by blocking the serotonin transporter. All SSRIs can cross the placenta to a variable degree dependent on their molecular weight, plasma protein binding, and pharmacokinetics.¹

They can also cross the blood-brain barrier² and, therefore, can affect fetal 5-HT levels. Activin A, a neuroprotein expressed after acute neuronal damage that may have a role in neuroprotection, is elevated in the amniotic fluid and cord blood of neonates born to mothers on SSRIs.³ However, whether this indicates neuroprotection or direct neuronal damage from SSRIs remains unclear at this time.

102. B. The clinical and EEG findings corresponding to each stage are not necessarily specific to the etiology of HIE but are manifestations of cerebral dysfunction that may occur with any newborn encephalopathy.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is categorized in 3 stages of increasing severity as delineated by Sarnat and Sarnat. The Sarnat classification score was developed with 21 neonates more than 36 weeks' gestation with HIE. These neonates were followed by serial neurological examinations, electroencephalogram (EEG) for the first 6 days after birth, as well as follow-up at 12 months after birth. Results from this study indicated that neonates with stage 1 (mild) encephalopathy or stage 2 (moderate) encephalopathy for less than 5 days had a good early childhood prognosis. The EEG correlated with the degree of encephalopathy on neurological examination but was not specific to hypoxia-ischemia as the cause of the encephalopathy.¹

Myelomeningoceles are secondary to a failure of primary neurulation and occur most commonly in the lumbosacral region. Partial or complete loss of function is anticipated below the level of the lesion. With regards to outcomes, the higher the lesion, the higher the risk of adverse cognitive outcomes as well as neurological deficits of the extremities, bowel, and bladder. Arnold-Chiari malformation type II is commonly associated with lumbosacral myelomeningoceles but not always.¹⁻³

105. C. Muscle weakness of the diaphragm, abdominal, and intercostal muscles can lead to poor forced vital capacity.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CTG repeats in the noncoding region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene on chromosome 19.

In the pediatric population, DM1 is classified as congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD, onset of symptoms at birth) and childhood myotonic dystrophy (ChMD, onset of symptoms between 1 and 10 years). Newborns with CMD present in the neonatal period with hypotonia, respiratory distress, poor feeding, talipes equinovarus, and eyelid ptosis.¹

Respiratory distress in the newborn period is caused by muscle weakness of the diaphragm, intercostal, and abdominal muscles, leading to decreased forced vital capacity. In addition, weakness of inspiratory, expiratory, and facial muscles results in poor cough effort and impairment in secretion clearing with high risk for aspiration and pneumonia. Most newborns requiring mechanical ventilation support in the newborn period can wean off their support. The mean duration of respiratory support is 26 weeks, and the 1-year mortality among infants with CMD requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 30 days is 25%.²

# 106. E. Sleep-wake cycles

The use of bedside amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) monitoring has been shown to be helpful in predicting later neurological outcomes in term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

Severely abnormal background patterns such as burst suppression on flat tracing or continuous low-voltage patterns without recovery at 24 hours predict poor outcomes with sensitivities of 91% to 95%, positive predictive values of 86% to 88%, and negative predictive values of 91% to 96%.¹⁻³

The timing of background pattern recovery is another important prognostic factor. Neonates with severely abnormal background patterns, including burst suppression, continuous low voltage, and flat tracing, but who recover to a normal background pattern within 48 hours after birth have a better prognosis, particularly those with earlier recovery of the aEEG background pattern.⁴ Similarly, earlier emergence of sleep-wake cycles is a good prognostic sign. Presence or absence of sleep-wake cycle at 36 hours after birth was found to correctly predict neurodevelopmental outcomes at a median age of 19 months in 82% of patients.⁵

# 108. C. Hypothermia

Therapeutic hypothermia is the only approved therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonates more than 35 to 36 weeks' gestational age. Therapeutic hypothermia has been studied in multiple large randomized trials that all showed a beneficial effect on 18- to 21-month neurodevelopmental outcomes. Meta-analyses of these trials indicate that therapeutic hypothermia is associated with decreased death or major neurodevelopmental disability, mortality, and major neurodevelopmental disability in survivors at 18 to 24 months. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 death or major disability is between 5 and 7.¹,² School-age outcomes, available from some of the CoolCap and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development whole-body cooling trial, support a sustained benefit of therapeutic hypothermia at 6- to 8-year outcomes.³

## 109. A. Clinical examination

Perinatal brachial plexus palsy is a peripheral nerve injury that can lead to long-term neurological impairments in 20% to 30% of patients.¹² Lesions to the lower trunk (C8 and T1) are more likely to result in long-term neurological impairment than lesions to the upper trunk (C5, C6, and ±C7): 66% of cases and 21% of cases, respectively.¹

The clinical assessment of function recovery, particularly that of biceps function,³ is critical in the decision to proceed with surgery for determination of the location and extent of the lesion as well as reconstruction of the brachial plexus. Typically, decisions to proceed with microsurgery over continued observation begin around 2 months after birth.⁴⁻⁶

## 110. B. Cases that developed in utero have been described.

Acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (AIDP), also known as Guillain-Barré syndrome, is an acquired demyelinating neuropathy and is rare in the neonatal period. It is important to distinguish acquired demyelinating neuropathy from inherited peripheral neuropathy because of different treatment options. Clues that an acquired demyelinating neuropathy is present include the absence of family history, a negative genetic workup, the presence of inflammation on nerve biopsy, and asymmetrical neurophysiological findings. The spontaneous resolution of symptoms confirms the diagnosis.¹

Neonates affected by AIDP may present with generalized hypotonia, progressive weakness, bulbar dysfunction, and respiratory distress. The neurological examination is significant for hyporeflexia. Prenatal onset of AIDP has been described with decreased fetal movements. In some cases, a triggering event in the mother can be identified, but not always. The disease typically resolves in less than 8 weeks.²⁻⁶

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of brain injury in term and preterm neonates. While most MRIs are performed at term equivalent postmenstrual age, MRIs can be safely performed in the preterm population. For preterm and term neonates and infants, MRI can be performed without sedation in most cases. The following general guidelines should be considered when performing brain MRI in the neonatal population:

- Adequate personnel must be available for preparation, transport, and monitoring. This should include personnel skilled in airway management for neonates requiring respiratory support or who are not medically stable.

- Preparation of the newborn should begin 30 to 45 minutes prior to scan time and includes connection to magnetic resonance-compatible equipment for continuous in scanner monitoring, removal of any metal-containing objects, placement of earmuffs, and plan for newborn swaddling. If available, the use of a vacuum bag is helpful to secure the newborn in place.
- Neonates do not have to be NPO (nil per os, or nothing by mouth) for the procedure. In fact, feeding 20 to 30 minutes prior to the scan may be helpful in the successful completion of an MRI study without sedation.¹,²

## 112. A. A combination of atropine, fentanyl, and vecuronium can be administered.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a policy statement recommending that all newborns receive analgesic premedication for endotracheal intubation with the exception of emergent intubations.¹ Most commonly, premedication for endotracheal intubation includes a rapid-acting analgesic (fentanyl, slow infusion), a vagolytic (atropine), and a short duration muscle relaxant.² This type of combination has been shown to decrease both time to intubation and number of intubation attempts.³ If the plan is to intubate for surfactant administration followed by rapid extubation, the use of a muscle relaxant should be omitted. For this situation, shorter acting drugs such as propofol or remifentanil are under investigation.⁴

## 113. D. Topiramate is an antiepileptic that may have a role in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, inhibiting neuronal excitability by blocking glutamate receptors.

Multiple agents are currently being investigated for the treatment of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Those include

- Erythropoietin (prevents N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] receptor activation and decreases free radical toxicity and inflammation)
- Xenon (blocks the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor, resulting in decreased activity and excitotoxicity)
- Allopurinol (inhibits xanthine oxidase and superoxide radical production)
- Melatonin (decreases free radical toxicity and inflammation)
- Topiramate (inhibits neuronal excitability via glutamate receptor blockade)
- Pluronic co-polymers (restore plasma membrane activity after injury)¹

## 114. B. External granular layer

Cerebellar development is prolonged beginning at 4 weeks' gestation and completing several weeks after birth. Because of this extended developmental period, the cerebellum is susceptible to a wide range of insults that, in addition to injury, may lead to abnormal cerebellar development. The external granular layer is particularly vulnerable to injury because it is relatively under-vascularized, and developmental events originating in the external granular cell layer occur over an extended period.¹,²

## 115. A. Colpocephaly

Agenesis of the corpus callosum occurs in 1 in 4,000 live births,¹ and the incidence increases to 2.3% among developmentally disabled populations.² Agenesis of the corpus callosum is associated with other brain malformations in 50% to 70% of patients²,³ and can be part of more than 100 syndromes, more prominently Aicardi syndrome and Zellweger syndrome.⁴

Agenesis of the corpus callosum can also occur in isolation. Complete agenesis of the corpus callosum results in the formation of the Probst bundle (secondary to the fibers that were destined to connect the 2 hemispheres traversing in anterior-posterior direction) and colpocephaly (enlargement of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricle).

## 116. B. Phenobarbital has lower protein binding and fewer interactions with other medications.

While phenobarbital is used more commonly than phenytoin, both antiseizure medications are equally effective in the treatment of neonatal seizures.¹ Disadvantages of phenytoin over phenobarbital include the following:

- Difficulties in maintaining therapeutic levels after transition to oral phenytoin.
- Higher protein binding of phenytoin and increased risk of drug-drug interactions.
- Risk of irritation and tissue injury with extravasation due to poor solubility at neutral pH and precipitation in solutions containing dextrose. This problem is greatly mitigated by the use of fosphenytoin.
- Possible bradycardia with rapid injections.

One advantage of phenytoin over phenobarbital is that it is less likely to cause sedation.

Both drugs are metabolized in the liver.²

## 117. A. Elevated cord blood concentrations of S100β have been linked to moderate or severe HIE.

In a neonate with moderate hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), the following biomarker profile is expected:

- Elevated S100β protein levels in cord blood or urine. Studies indicate that a protein S100β concentration greater than 2.02 mcg/L in cord blood has a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 88% for predicting the moderate or severe HIE.¹
- Elevated serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (&gt;40 mcg/L) between 4 hours and 48 hours after birth.²
- Elevated interleukin 6 levels in cord blood. Interleukin 6 levels in cord blood have been shown correlate with the severity of HIE as well as with the 2-year neurodevelopmental outcomes.³
- Elevated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a cytoskeletal filament protein specific to astrocytes and released into the bloodstream after astrocyte death. Serum levels of GFAP 0.15 ng/mL or higher on neonatal intensive care unit admission have been shown to be predictive of abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging findings.⁴
- Elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor in cord plasma.⁵

118. A. Although SSRI use has been associated with Arnold-Chiari malformations type I, because of the nature of studies, it is difficult to interpret whether SSRI exposure itself increases that risk or that another factor linked to higher likelihood of SSRI use plays the larger role.

In utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been associated with a small increase in the risk of neurological anomalies in some studies, mostly driven by exposure to fluoxetine and paroxetine.¹

In a Bayesian analysis, Reefhuis and colleagues found an increased risk of anencephaly with paroxetine (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% CI, 1.6–6.2) and an increased risk of craniosynostosis with fluoxetine (OR 1.9, 95% CI, 1.1–3.0). In this study, the use of sertraline was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations.²

In a population-based study, Bérard and colleagues found that the use of both sertraline and non-sertraline SSRIs led to an increased risk of craniosynostosis.³

Another study indicated that the use of SSRIs also increased the risk of Arnold-Chiari malformation type I in the newborn when compared to babies born to mothers with no history of depression or SSRI use (18% vs 2%, P = .003). In this cohort study, the duration of exposure was found to be a factor.⁴

Overall, studies do not distinguish between the effect of depression and that of SSRI exposure.

Because the absolute risk of neurological malformation is small, discontinuation of SSRI therapy in a pregnant woman with depression and well-controlled symptoms on SSRIs is not recommended.

119. E. Sonic hedgehog gene signaling inhibition

The teratogenic effects of alcohol in the brain are mediated by multiple mechanisms including

- Alcohol is an agonist to the γ-amino butyric acid A receptor and an antagonist to the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor, leading to apoptosis.¹
- Increased free radical production with subsequent lipid peroxidation and cell death.²
- Increased nitric oxide production resulting in peroxynitrite production.²
- Alcohol affects pathways important in central nervous system organization and neuronal cell migration.³,⁴
- Inhibition of the sonic hedgehog gene signaling, which plays a critical role in early morphogenesis of the limb and midline brain structures.⁵

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonates presenting with hypotonia. The hypotonia improves by age 2 to 3. Other clinical features of PWS in the neonatal period include lethargy, decreased spontaneous movement, weak cry, and feeding difficulties.

The following physical examination findings may also raise the suspicion for PWS:

- Hypogonadism and cryptorchidism (80%–90% of affected males)
- Characteristic facial features including dolichocephaly, narrowed bifrontal diameter, almond-shaped palpebral fissures, and narrow nasal bridge

## 121. B. Cerebral palsy is a clinical description and lacks specific pathological or radiographic features, with some neonates with CP having a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging scan.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a clinical description of disorders related to movement and motor abnormalities that are nonprogressive in nature and secondary to injury to the developing fetal or infant brain. Cerebral palsy is associated with impairments in cognitive, communication, and social functioning.

The prevalence of CP ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births in the United States.¹,² The incidence of CP is higher among those born preterm, with the highest incidence seen among neonates born at less than 25 weeks' gestation (15%–20%).³,⁴ While preterm birth is a risk factor for CP, 50% of all cases of CP occur in term neonates.⁵

A diagnosis of CP is typically not formally made until age 2, but early signs such as abnormal tone, feeding issues, early hand preference, prominent fisting, asymmetrical crawling, persistence of primitive reflexes, ankle clonus, and scissoring of legs may raise the suspicion of CP earlier.⁶

## 122. A. Neonates with mild encephalopathy have been shown to have more behavioral problems such as anxiety, depression, and attention regulation, compared with control participants.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is categorized in 3 stages of increasing severity as delineated by Sarnat and Sarnat.¹ Neonates with mild encephalopathy or moderate encephalopathy lasting less than 5 days have improved outcomes compared with those with prolonged moderate encephalopathy or those with severe encephalopathy. In a meta-analysis, adverse outcomes were observed in 0%, 32%, and 100% of neonates with mild, moderate, and severe encephalopathy score, respectively.²

Importantly, while neonates with mild encephalopathy do not have severe neurodevelopmental disabilities, they are at increased risk of the following adverse outcomes compared with control participants:

- Lower mean (SD) IQ scores (99 [17] vs 109 [12])³
- Increased rates of behavioral problems at 9 to 10 years of age such as anxiety, depression, attention regulation, and thought problems⁴

## 124. E. Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction and resulting in weakness and fatigability of striated muscles. There are 3 clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis in childhood.¹

- Juvenile myasthenia gravis, which occurs in late infancy and childhood. It is the most common form of myasthenia gravis in childhood but remains rare, representing approximately 10% of all cases of myasthenia gravis in Western populations. It is caused by antibodies passing against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR, 85% of cases) or against the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSKR, 15% of cases).
- Congenital myasthenia gravis, a rare familial form of myasthenia gravis that is not associated with antibodies.
- Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis, which affects 10% to 20% of newborns of mothers with myasthenia gravis. Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis is due to the transplacental passage of anti-AChR or anti-MuSKR with resultant neuromuscular junction blockade in the newborn.²

## 125. D. The 2011 study by Pinto-Martin and colleagues found an autism prevalence of 5% among a preterm cohort of neonates less than 2,000 g birth weight.

Neonates born preterm, with a low birth weight, or with neonatal medical complexity have an increased risk of having autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In a prospective study with rigorous diagnosis of ASD, Pinto-Martin and colleagues found that neonates with a birth weight less than 2,000 g have prevalence of ASD of 5%, 3 times that of the general population.¹ Because of this increased risk, screening for ASD using tools such as the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers is at the 18- and 24-month visits for these high-risk children.²

Studies indicate that children with ASD are more likely to be macrocephalic, have mothers with low prenatal vitamin D levels, and have a history of neonatal anemia or jaundice.

## 126. B. Atypical behaviors may be present, such as stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, insistence on sameness, and highly restricted or fixed interests.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurs in 1 in 68 children and is 5 times more common in boys. The prevalence of ASD has been increasing over the past several decades, from 6.7 per 1,000 children in 2000 to 14.7 per 1,000 children in 2010.¹

Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by²

- Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction including difficulties with social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and relationships such as interactive play with peers.
- Presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of atypical behavior, interests, or activities. These may include repetitive, stereotypical motor movements, insistence on sameness, highly restricted or fixated interests, and hyperreactivity or hyporeactivity to sensory input.

Neurology

- Symptoms that are present in early childhood and impair daily functioning.

The average age of diagnosis of ASD is 4 years; however, earlier behavioral markers may be noted in infants as young as 12 months. The following deviations in development have been proposed by the American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society as absolute red flags for a possible ASD diagnosis:

- No babbling, pointing, or use of nonverbal gestures by 12 months
- No single words by 16 months
- No 2-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months
- Loss of language or social skills at any age

## 127. A. Abnormal neurological examination findings

The incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has decreased over the past several decades, occurring in 1.5 per 1,000 live term births in developed countries. About 25% of survivors are at risk of adverse developmental outcomes including motor deficits, memory impairment, visual motor or visual perceptive dysfunction, hyperactivity, and learning disabilities. The risk of impairment increases with the degree of encephalopathy. In the first few days after birth, an abnormal neurological examination finding is the single most useful predictor that a brain insult has occurred in the perinatal period.

## 128. C. The latent phase following an initial ischemic insult lasts 6 to 15 hours.

The pathogenesis of brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia is complex and is characterized by overlapping phases of injury that evolve over time.

- The initial (primary) phase of injury is due to the abrupt interruption of substrates delivery (oxygen and glucose) to the brain, resulting in necrotic cell death.
- This initial phase of injury is followed by a latent phase that lasts between 6 hours and 15 hours. This period represents a therapeutic window during which the institution therapies to mitigate further injury can be implemented, including therapeutic hypothermia.
- The secondary phase of neuronal injury is characterized by apoptotic cell death, with most of the burden of neuronal injury and death occurring during this phase. Multiple mechanisms are involved during the secondary phase including excitotoxicity, free radical production, and activation of inflammatory cascades.

Head instability is essential to motor behavior during the first 2 postnatal months. At that stage, if manual support to the neck and spine is provided, one will observe the following:

- Diversification of facial expressions
- Decrease in the flexor of the upper extremities with opening of the hands
- Intentional reaching and grasping of an object
- Temporary disappearance of the Moro and grasp reflexes

This supported state has been described as the liberated state and can be observed in newborns as young as 2 weeks. A positive liberated state provides supportive evidence of the integrity of the upper (corticospinal) system.

Of note, the presence of periventricular leukomalacia or intraparenchymal hemorrhage increases the risk of CP regardless of the degree of prematurity.² In preterm neonates, additional risk factors include exposure to postnatal steroids, need for high-frequency ventilation, prolonged mechanical ventilation, pneumothorax, male sex, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, African American race, and low socioeconomic status.³,⁴

While preterm birth is a significant risk factor for CP, 50% of all cases of CP occur in term neonates.⁵ In this population, risk factors include

- Maternal factors: chorioamnionitis, maternal intellectual disability, hypothyroidism, and severe proteinuria
- Neonate factors: ischemic stroke, neonatal encephalopathy, noncentral nervous system malformations, cerebral dysgenesis, 5-minute Apgar score 3 or less, intrauterine growth restriction, birth weight less than 2,000 g, and severe hyperbilirubinemia

## 132. C. There may be increased muscle tone, tremors, jitteriness, difficulty sleeping, or respiratory distress.

Neonatal adaptation syndrome can occur in newborns exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in utero. Affected newborns may present with hypertonia, tremors, jitteriness, feeding issues, difficulty sleeping, and respiratory distress.¹

Neonatal adaptation syndrome occurs in 22% to 49% of newborns exposed to SSRIs.²,³ Symptoms are typically mild and resolve within 2 to 6 days. In a study from Forsberg and colleagues, only 3% of exposed neonates were classified as having severe symptoms with a Finnegan score greater than 8.² In another study, 12.3% of exposed neonates were classified as having severe symptoms.³ There is no benefit of SRRI discontinuation for the last 2 weeks of pregnancy.⁴

In general, affected neonates respond well to nonpharmacological measures including skin-to-skin care, swaddling, and feeding on demand. Breastfeeding has been shown to decrease neonatal adaption syndrome symptoms.⁵

## 133. B. Erb palsy

Neonatal brachial plexus palsy occurs in 0.3 to 3.0 per 1,000 live births and is classified into 4 anatomical groups based on neurological findings at 2 to 3 weeks of age.¹

- Group I: lesion level C5-C6 with paralysis of shoulder and biceps
- Group II: lesion level C5-C7 with paralysis of shoulder, biceps, and forearm extensors
- Group III: lesion level C5-T1 with complete paralysis of limb
- Group IV: lesion level C5-T1 with complete paralysis of limb with Horner syndrome

Erb palsy is an upper trunk lesion (group I) resulting in the "waiter's tip" posture, with shoulder adduction and internal rotation, elbow extension, forearm pronation, and wrist flexion. On the affected side, the Moro reflex is absent but the grasp reflex is present. It is the most common form of neonatal brachial plexus injury, representing greater than 50% of all cases.²

## 134. E. Symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows for the continuous, noninvasive bedside monitoring of cerebral tissue oxygenation 2.5 to 3.0 cm below the sensor. For neonates, NIRS monitoring has been used to study cerebral autoregulation, predict outcomes in preterm neonates, for the perioperative treatment of neonates with complex congenital heart diseases, and for neonates on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

For preterm neonates, NIRS monitoring has been shown to be helpful in the prediction of intraventricular hemorrhage.¹ Further, it can be used to monitor preterm neonates with hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus.²

## 135. D. The disease is caused by a CTG repeat within the 3' untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene on chromosome 19q13.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CTG repeats in the noncoding region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene on chromosome 19. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is classified as congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD, onset of symptoms at birth) and childhood myotonic dystrophy (onset of symptoms between 1 years and 10 years of age), and adult DM1 (diagnosis after 10 years). The prevalence of DM1 is 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 8,000, with CMD representing 10% to 30% of all DM1 cases. Pediatric mortality rates are between 17% and 41%, with the most common cause of death being respiratory failure. Most infants requiring mechanical ventilation support in the newborn period will wean off their support with a mean duration of respiratory support of 26 weeks. The 1-year mortality among infants with CMD requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 30 days is 25% and 30% if the need for mechanical support is greater than 90 days.¹,²

## 136. E. Release of apoptosis-triggering caspase proteins

The pathophysiology of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is complex and occurs in multiple phases including a primary energy failure phase, a latent period, and a secondary energy failure phase. The severity of the secondary energy failure phase is variable and depends on the degree of primary failure. The pathways activated during the secondary energy failure phase include$^{1,2}$

- Activation of microglia and inflammatory response
- Caspases release and activation of apoptotic pathways
- Decreased growth factors and protein synthesis
- Further accumulation of excitotoxic neurotransmitters

## 137. A. Enhanced gray-white matter signal contrast

The prenatal diagnosis of agenesis of the corpus callosum using ultrasound is difficult and is inferred from the failure to visualize the cavum septum pellucidum between 18 and 20 weeks' gestation. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging technique of choice, allowing for the visualization of the corpus callosum by 20 weeks' gestation. Fetal MRI performed between 20 and 23 weeks' gestation will also detect other overt brain anomalies such as hydrocephalus but may miss migrational or myelination defects. A repeat fetal MRI between 28 and 34 weeks is helpful to diagnose these subtler lesions prenatally, because of enhanced gray-white matter differentiation and development of cortical gyration.$^{1,2}$

## 138. B. Abnormal joint mobility

Connective tissue disorders (CTDs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders affecting extracellular matrix protein. They affect 1 in 2,000 people and can present in the neonatal period. The presentation of CTDs in the newborn is highly variable but most commonly involves abnormal joint motility with either marked hypermotility or joint contractures.$^{1}$

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) most commonly follows in utero chronic opioid use or abuse (heroin, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, codeine, and/or buprenorphine). About 60% of exposed newborns will develop NAS with onset of symptoms typically between 24 and 72 hours after birth. It is important to recognize that delayed presentation can occur, up to 5 to 7 days after birth.$^{2,3}$

## 140. A. Finnegan scoring system

Multiple scoring systems are available for the evaluation of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) severity. Among those, the Finnegan scoring system is the most studied and the most widely used.$^{1}$ The Finnegan scoring system scores 20 items in 4 categories: neurological, state, respiratory, and gastrointestinal. In general, a score of 8 or greater indicates more severe NAS and is used by some as an indication for pharmacological treatment initiation. Of note, the Eat, Sleep, Console approach, which focuses on the functional effect of NAS on the neonate, has been gaining ground and has led to significant decreases in the need for pharmacological interventions.$^{2}$

## 141. D. Ischemia-reperfusion injury

Cerebellar hemorrhage is increasingly recognized as an important form of brain injury in preterm neonates. Cranial ultrasonographic studies using the mastoid views indicate higher incidence of cerebellar hemorrhage than previously thought, 19% among preterm neonates less than 750 g at birth.¹ The most common locations of hemorrhage are the primary and secondary germinal matrices in the deep subependymal and superficial subpial regions. Ischemia-reperfusion mechanisms also appear to play a role, with frequent microscopic hemorrhagic lesions in under-vascularized areas identified on pathology studies.

## 142. A. Diffuse non-cystic myelination disturbance is the predominant form of white matter injury.

Periventricular white matter injury (PWMI) is in large part due to injury to the pre-myelinating oligodendrocyte progenitors. Periventricular white matter injury includes a spectrum of injury most often classified as focal cystic lesions (also known as cystic periventricular leukomalacia, cPVL) or diffuse lesions.¹,²

Focal cystic PWMI (or cPVL) is characterized by symmetrical lesions adjacent to the anterior and posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, most commonly in the frontal and parietal-occipital periventricular white matter. These cystic lesions are readily detected by cranial ultrasonography. In contrast, diffuse PWMI can be missed on cranial ultrasound, and brain magnetic resonance imaging is the diagnostic study of choice. Studies indicate that the incidence of focal cystic PWMI has decreased, accounting for less than 5% of cases of PWMI.³⁻⁶

Maternal autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis can affect the fetal brain in a gestational-age-specific manner. Extensive stroke secondary to occlusion of a large intracerebral artery typically occurs in a fetus closer to term, while white matter injury secondary to vaso-occlusive more commonly occurs in fetuses less than 34 weeks' gestation.¹

## 144. D. Righting reaction

With birth, the newborn experiences the effects of gravity for the first time. The full righting reaction is one of the major counter-gravity responses that a newborn will demonstrate when placed in the upright position. With tactile stimulation of the soles and activation of extensor muscles, a newborn can actively sustain his/her body weight for a few seconds. This is a brainstem response that evolves in a caudo-cephalic fashion, restricted to the lower extremities around 28 weeks' gestational age and reaching the head between 38 and 40 weeks' gestational age.¹,²

RENAL

1. D. Hyperkalemia

Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is caused by hypoaldosteronism or a decreased response to aldosterone. In the neonate, this can result from congenital hyperplasia or adrenal injury. Affected neonates present with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis.¹

There are several complications that can occur after bladder exstrophy repair. These include the following¹,²:

- Bladder dehiscence
- Osteotomy complication
- Infection
- Bladder stone formation
- Fistula formation (urethrocutaneous or vesicocutaneous fistula)
- Difficulty with urination

Dehiscence of the bladder is the most reliable predictor of long-term outcomes after surgical repair of bladder exstrophy.

Hypercalcemic hypercalciuria can cause renal calcifications in preterm neonates because of the following:

- Subcutaneous fat necrosis
- Hyperparathyroidism
- Hypophosphatasia
- Williams syndrome
- Vitamin D toxicity
- Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia

A neonate with subcutaneous fat necrosis presents with firm subcutaneous nodules that can be as large as several centimeters and that are located on the back, buttocks, face (cheeks, chin), arms, and thighs. Affected neonates often have a history of perinatal depression or hypoperfusion. A few weeks after the nodules appear, some patients develop severe hypercalcemia associated with nephrocalcinosis, emesis, irritability, poor growth, and possibly seizures.¹ In severe cases, complications such as persistent seizures, blindness, and even death can occur.

Many different grading systems have been developed to assess the degree of fetal hydronephrosis.

## 7. D. Number of glomeruli

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) depends mostly on the number of glomeruli, which increases in utero until approximately 35 to 36 weeks’ gestation. Once the total number of glomeruli is attained, the GFR increases relative to renal mass and changes in renal hemodynamics. Renal growth and development are affected by intrauterine growth restriction, maternal hypertension, and postnatal illness, which can have long-term effects on renal function.

## 8. D. Oligohydramnios may indicate a more severe abnormality that may require emergent intervention postnatally.

Nonrenal prenatal findings can help to determine the cause of the prenatal hydronephrosis:

- Hydroureter without a distended bladder → possible obstruction at the ureterovesicular junction
- Hydroureter with a distended bladder → possible obstruction of the urethra

The finding of oligohydramnios, indicating a significant decrease in urine output, is associated with a more severe renal abnormality that might require emergent intervention postnatally.

## 9. D. Restrict fluid intake to a total volume equal to insensible losses plus urine output replacement.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is managed supportively in neonates. If a prerenal cause is suspected, normal saline boluses can be administered. However, if there is no increase in urine output or decrease in serum creatinine after the boluses, additional boluses are not recommended because of the risk of fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and anasarca. If a neonate becomes hypotensive, vasoactive agents are recommended. If there is a high chance that the AKI is related to intrinsic renal disease, the best fluid management strategy is to restrict fluid intake to a total volume equal to insensible water losses plus urine output replacement. Maximal parenteral nutrition should be provided. Monitoring for associated electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia) is also important because corrections may be needed.

## 10. A. Chronic exposure to catecholamines leads to a decreased number of cardiac β-adrenergic receptors.

In response to cardiac failure, compensatory mechanisms include an increase in adrenal epinephrine secretion and release of neural norepinephrine. This leads to increased sympathetic tone, with an associated increase in heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output. However, chronic sympathetic stimulation can have deleterious effects, such as direct toxicity to the myocardium and a decrease in the number of β-adrenergic receptors in the heart because of tachyphylaxis. There can also be a decrease in

Newborns with renal vein thrombosis present with hypertension, gross hematuria, and thrombocytopenia.

## 13. E. Spironolactone

Loop diuretics (eg, bumetanide and furosemide) and thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide and metolazone) need to be delivered to the renal tubular lumen to exert their pharmacological effect. In contrast, aldosterone antagonists (eg, spironolactone) compete with aldosterone and bind to receptors on the cortical collecting tubule cells.

## 14. D. Production of fetal urine begins at 9-weeks' gestational age, and the fetal bladder is visible by ultrasonography starting at 13-weeks' gestational age.

Fetal ultrasonography is extremely useful for the detection of major renal anomalies. The fetus begins to produce urine at 9-weeks' gestational age, and the fetal bladder is visible by ultrasonography at 13-weeks' gestational age. By 20-weeks' gestational age, 90% of the amniotic fluid is composed of fetal urine. Fetal ultrasonography can detect fetal kidneys at 12-weeks' gestational age, with distinction of the renal cortex and medulla being evident by 25-weeks' gestational age. Fetal hydronephrosis can be identified at 18- to 22-weeks' gestational age, usually by means of routine fetal screening. The finding of severe fetal hydronephrosis during the third trimester is more predictive of a renal or urinary tract anomaly.¹

## 16. B. Collecting duct

Each part of the nephron plays a different role in water regulation. In the proximal renal convoluted tubule, sodium is actively transported across the tubule wall, and water passively follows. In the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubules, there is active reabsorption of solutes, but these sections are mostly impermeable to water. Hypotonic urine then enters the collecting duct where most of the reabsorption of water is tightly regulated by arginine vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone.

17. A. In kidneys affected by MCDK disease, there is essentially no normally differentiated renal epithelium.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) disease is the most severe form of renal cystic dysplasia, with almost completely undifferentiated renal epithelium as a result of limited ureteric bud branching.¹ Normally, there are approximately 300,000 to 1,000,000 nephrons in a neonatal kidney; however, in MCDK disease, there are fewer than 300,000 nephrons. The most common form of MCDK disease is unilateral, which is associated with a good prognosis²; however, if there is bilateral involvement, the outcome is poor.

18. B. High mean airway pressures in neonates receiving ventilation have been associated with AKI, possibly because of impaired venous return and decreased cardiac output.

The causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in neonates can be classified into 3 categories: prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal.

The primary prerenal cause is renal hypoperfusion as a result of the following:

- Hypovolemia from decreased fluid intake, excessive fluid losses, or third spacing with decreased intravascular volume
- Decreased cardiac output (eg, high mean airway pressures from the ventilator, impairing venous return)¹
- Medications that decrease afferent arteriole dilatation (eg, ibuprofen, indomethacin)
- Medications that block efferent arteriole constriction (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors)
- Increased abdominal pressure resulting in compartment syndrome

Any of these prerenal causes of AKI can lead to intrinsic renal injury. Intrinsic injury can also result from interstitial nephritis, cortical necrosis after severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury, or a direct effect of nephrotoxic medications (eg, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, intravenous contrast material), particularly in neonates of lower birth weight.²

Postrenal causes of AKI involve obstruction of the flow of urine. Causes include prenatal abnormalities, such as posterior urethral valves or obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction, whereas postnatal causes include urethral strictures, trauma after catheterization, or abdominal masses.

19. C. 36 weeks

By 8 weeks' gestation, the first nephron is formed, and fetal urine production begins. At 20 weeks' gestation, urine production is established, and approximately one-third of the full complement of nephrons has developed.¹ At 36 weeks' gestation, the number of nephrons is the same as that in adults.¹ Preterm neonates born younger than 36-weeks' gestational age are still in the process of nephrogenesis, and exposure to medications can affect the development of their kidneys, including nephron numbers.²,³

Although older studies found that the prevalence of acute renal failure is 24% in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, newer data indicate a lower prevalence (between 3% and 8%) in this population.¹ The most common causes of acute renal failure in neonates are severe perinatal asphyxia (40%), sepsis (22%), and feeding difficulties (18%).²

## 21. D. May help to explain the inconsistent response of neonates to diuretic therapy but currently lack clinical relevance

Pharmacogenomics is a new field that seeks to individualize drug treatment on the basis of a patient’s specific genotype. At present, the clinical applicability of this approach is minimal because of lack of availability of genotype testing, inconsistent correlation of a patient’s genotype to a response, and limited data. However, pharmacogenomics has the potential to explain the variability in patient responses to medications, such as the inconsistent response of neonates to diuretic therapy.

## 22. E. Basolateral Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase

In addition to affecting renal hemodynamics and tubular function, catecholamines regulate the Na⁺/K⁺-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) enzyme on the basolateral membrane of the renal tubule.¹ This enzyme is involved in renal solute transport, leading to increased sodium absorption. Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase enzyme activity increases in response to α- and β-adrenergic receptor stimulation and decreases in response to dopamine receptor stimulation.¹

## 23. D. Diagnosed by means of fetal ultrasonography with large fluid-filled renal cysts observed by 20 weeks’ gestation

Multcystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) disease is diagnosed by means of fetal ultrasonography with echogenic kidneys containing multiple large cysts that are visible by 20 weeks’ gestation.¹ This is in contrast to polycystic kidney disease in which cysts are not visible until later in gestation. While MCDK disease is usually unilateral, bilateral involvement can occur. The underlying cause of MCDK disease is varied and has been associated with many genetic mutations. In contrast, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is attributed to mutations in a single gene, the PKHD1 gene, which is located on chromosome 6p21.

Patients with mild MCKD disease do not usually develop hypertension. However, chronic renal failure occurs in 12% to 50% of affected patients, even if only 1 kidney is involved.¹ Previous reports indicated an increased risk of Wilms tumor in the affected kidney, leading to routine nephrectomies in patients with MCKD disease. However, studies found that this risk is minimal, and some centers now monitor patients periodically with ultrasonography instead of performing routine surgery.²

## 24. B. No identifiable cause

In approximately 50% of patients with fetal hydronephrosis, this finding has no identifiable cause and resolves before birth.¹ If the hydronephrosis persists and a cause is identified, it is usually as a result of anatomical abnormalities such as ureteropelvic, vesicoureteral, or ureterovesical junction obstruction. Vesicoureteral reflux can also lead to fetal hydronephrosis. Less frequent causes include collagen disorders, neurological impairment, malignancy, and prune-belly syndrome.

## 25. C. If the bladder and posterior urethra are also dilated, there is a strong suggestion of posterior urethral valves.

Determining the severity of fetal hydronephrosis requires assessing the degree of renal pelvis dilatation, the degree of calyceal dilatation, and the effect on the renal parenchyma.¹ In addition to evaluation of the kidneys, it is also helpful to determine the degree of dilatation of the ureters, the presence or absence of a distended bladder, and the presence or absence of a dilated posterior urethra. A fetus with ureteropelvic junction obstruction will demonstrate hydronephrosis with normal-sized ureters and bladder; this type of

obstruction can be bilateral in 10% to 40% of cases.² Bilateral dilated ureters with a normal-sized bladder on ultrasonography are consistent with bilateral ureterovesical junction obstruction that has a high chance of spontaneous resolution.³ Dilatation of both ureters with a distended bladder suggests a possible obstruction as a result of posterior urethral valves. Fetuses who also have oligohydramnios are more likely to have a severe abnormality requiring immediate postdelivery intervention.

## 26. E. Angiotensin II stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone.

In response to a decrease in renal blood flow, renin levels increase, which leads to increased production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II has several functions, including the following:

- Increase in water and salt reabsorption in the renal tubules¹
- Vasoconstriction of systemic and renal arterioles²
- Stimulation of the adrenal cortex to produce aldosterone, further increasing sodium reabsorption in renal tubules and nonrenal sites³
- Increase in glomerular filtration⁴
- Possible vascular smooth muscle cell and myocardial hypertrophy⁵

Proposed neonatal AKI classification

[tbl-0.html](tbl-0.html)

a Baseline SCr is defined as the lowest previous SCr value.

30. A. Perform renal ultrasonography in 3 to 6 weeks

Neonates with a prenatal diagnosis of mild hydronephrosis have a low risk of urinary tract infection, and most affected patients have spontaneous resolution of their hydronephrosis. Postnatal renal ultrasonography at 3 to 6 weeks of age is helpful to determine whether additional imaging is needed.

31. B. Decreased afferent arteriole stretch leading to stimulation of renal baroreceptors

The kidneys increase renin secretion in response to a decrease in afferent arteriole stretch or pressure; this leads to a stimulation of renal baroreceptors. $^{1,2}$ In addition, other mechanisms of increased renin secretion include the following:

- Increased renal sympathetic activity and stimulation of the renal $\beta_{1}$ adrenergic receptors $^{1,2}$
- Decreased sodium chloride transport to the macula densa $^{1,2}$

Neonates can have nephrocalcinosis with normal urinary and serum calcium levels if primary or secondary hyperoxaluria is present. Primary hyperoxaluria has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern that leads to excessive calcium oxalate renal deposits. In its most severe form, primary hyperoxaluria occurs in 3- to 4-month-olds who present with failure to thrive, seizures, and renal failure. $^{1}$ Secondary hyperoxaluria can occur in newborns with short bowel syndrome and malabsorption.

There are 3 general categories of the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC)$^{1,2}$:

1. Classic bladder exstrophy: This is the most common type of BEEC, occurring in 60% of cases. Affected patients have an exposed, inside out bladder and a visible dorsal urethra at the lower part of the abdominal wall. The external genitalia are involved in all affected patients, and an inguinal hernia is present in most patients.
2. Epispadias: This mild phenotype is present in 30% of cases. Affected patients have an open urethral plate and an abnormal urethral location. Affected males have an ectopic meatal opening or a mucosal strip on the dorsal side of the penis, and affected females have a urethral cleft.
3. Cloacal exstrophy: Patients with this type (10% of cases) are most severely affected and present with bladder and large intestine extrusion, along with abnormalities of the anus, genitalia, and colon.

## 34. A. Hypercalciuria

Patients with type 1 renal tubular acidosis (RTA), also known as distal RTA, have decreased acid secretion into the distal tubule. Typical laboratory findings associated with this disorder include the following¹,²:

- Hypokalemia: potassium replaces hydrogen as a cation in the urine
- Hypocitraturia: citrate is reabsorbed to create bicarbonate
- Hypercalciuria: possibly caused by increased calcium secretion from bone to serve as a buffer and increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubule with associated increase in calcium renal excretion
- High urine pH with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap

## 35. D. Plasma flow rate

The hallmark of prerenal failure in the development of decreased glomerular filtration is decreased plasma flow rate to the kidneys. This is caused by either volume contraction or decreased cardiac output. If these conditions are treated, renal perfusion can be restored, and normal renal function can return. However, if volume replacement is inadequate or cardiac output remains low, prerenal failure will persist, potentially leading to renal injury.

## 36. A. Accompanied by oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia in severe cases

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is caused by a mutation on the PKHD1 gene on chromosome 6p21. The diagnosis can be made prenatally by fetal ultrasonography with multiple small renal cysts visible after 20 weeks’ gestation and large, echogenic kidneys. In severe cases, oligohydramnios, the Potter phenotype, and pulmonary hypoplasia can occur.¹ Postnatally, in addition to polycystic renal findings, neonates with ARPKD have hepatic fibrosis with some degree of biliary dysgenesis.² If patients survive the neonatal period, long-term complications such as chronic renal insufficiency, growth failure, hyponatremia, and severe hypertension (associated with low plasma renin concentrations) can occur.³

The VACTERL association is associated with at least 3 of the following findings: vertebral abnormalities, anal atresia, esophageal atresia or tracheoesophageal fistula, renal abnormalities, and limb anomalies.¹ The renal abnormalities can vary and include hydronephrosis, ectopic kidneys, renal agenesis, and renal dysplasia.¹

There is some overlap between the clinical findings of VACTERL and Holt-Oram syndrome (caused by a mutation in the transcription factor TBX5) and those of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (caused by a mutation in the DHCR7 gene).²

## 38. D. Preterm neonates have an impaired renal ability to reabsorb sodium and water.

After birth, preterm neonates have an increase in creatinine levels in the first few days, with neonates of younger gestational age having the most significant increase.¹ This increase in creatinine begins to decrease gradually after 4 days.¹ Preterm neonates have an impaired renal ability to reabsorb sodium and water, which corresponds to the large diuresis in this population during the first week after birth.² This is associated with a lower maximum urine osmolality of 500 mOsm/L (500 mmol/kg) in preterm neonates compared with a maximum urine osmolality of 800 mOsm/L (800 mmol/kg) in term neonates.² Preterm neonates also have a lower glomerular filtration rate than do term neonates, with both preterm and term neonates reaching adult levels at approximately 1 year of age.²

40. A. ACE inhibitors block the pathway that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Use of ACE inhibitors significantly reduces dysfunction of the left ventricle and mortality in adults with heart failure. $^{1}$ By decreasing systemic vascular resistance (ie, decreasing afterload), left ventricular function and cardiac output improve. ACE inhibitors also have the potential of reversing left ventricular hypertrophy if used long term. $^{2}$ By preventing the breakdown of bradykinin, ACE inhibitors lead to an increase in bradykinin, $^{3}$ which causes a cough in 5% to 35% of patients. $^{4}$

The use of ACE inhibitors in neonates and infants could lead to renal injury, so monitoring of renal function is necessary in this population. This effect is not dose dependent and is more common in preterm neonates. $^{5,6}$ A study conducted by the Pediatric Heart Network in 230 infants with single-ventricle physiology found that the use of enalapril did not improve survival, somatic growth, or ventricular function in the first year. $^{7}$ However, this study had several limitations (eg, small sample size, intervention occurring after surgery), so further data are needed to be certain of lack of effect.

## 41. C. Angiotensin II

Angiotensin II serves as a renal growth factor and plays an important role in renal development.¹ Pregnant rats that were fed a protein-restricted diet had pups with a suppressed fetal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and abnormal renal development.²,³ Transgenic or knockout animals that lacked genes within the RAS had severe impairment of nephrogenesis.⁴

## 42. E. The serum creatinine level will normally increase during the first days after birth before gradually decreasing.

In preterm neonates, the serum creatinine level will normally increase during the first days after birth before gradually decreasing.¹ The younger the neonate's birth gestational age, the greater the increase in creatinine.¹ The neonate's creatinine level at birth reflects maternal creatinine levels and is not helpful in assessing renal function. After this period, creatinine levels correlate with the patient's glomerular filtration rate, but this level is not a sensitive test for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury in children.² Protein intake should not be restricted in neonates with acute kidney injury.

## 43. E. Transient dilation is less common with severe antenatal hydronephrosis.

Most patients (41%–88%) with a prenatal diagnosis of mild hydronephrosis have a transient nonobstructive dilation that has no clinical significance.¹ Neonates with unilateral mild to moderate hydronephrosis do not require imaging in the newborn period; instead, a renal ultrasound is recommended at 3 to 6 weeks after discharge.

Neonates with severe antenatal hydronephrosis are at increased risk of persistent dilation, with greater risk of urinary tract infections, need for surgery, or development of chronic kidney disease.¹ Affected neonates require evaluation prior to discharge.

Although neonates with a diagnosis of severe antenatal hydronephrosis should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics, neonates with mild antenatal hydronephrosis only require antibiotics if there are other abnormalities such as ureterocele, bladder abnormalities, hydroureter, or urinary obstruction.¹

## 44. D. Spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist, decreasing sodium reabsorption and preventing potassium loss.

There are several agents to treat heart failure in adults that act by inhibiting different steps in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. A renin inhibitor prevents angiotensinogen from being converted into angiotensin I. For example, aliskiren treats heart failure by blocking plasma renin activity.¹ Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.

Spironolactone acts downstream as a competitive aldosterone receptor antagonist, leading to a decrease in sodium reabsorption and potassium loss. In addition, this corticosteroid decreases both the turnover of extracellular matrix, a critical factor in cardiac remodeling, and myocardial collagen levels.² If spironolactone is used concomitantly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, patients are at risk for hyperkalemia.³ Eplerenone, another mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, is more selective than is spironolactone.⁴

Angiotensin receptor blockers competitively block the angiotensin I receptor.

## 45. D. Recent data suggest that even mild forms of congenital kidney disease that are benign during childhood may progress to end-stage renal disease in adulthood.

There are 5 progressive stages of chronic kidney disease, with stages 1 to 4 accounting for most childhood cases. $^{1,2}$ The final stage, stage 5, is end-stage renal disease and has a low prevalence in children. $^{1,2}$ Chronic kidney disease has a broad effect on life, affecting a child's growth, nutrition, and social development. Recent data suggest that even mild forms of congenital kidney disease that are benign during childhood may progress to end-stage renal disease in adulthood. $^{3}$ However, of all patients with end-stage renal failure, only $2\%$ are children. $^{1,2}$ The life expectancy of a child who starts dialysis is 20 years from the initiation of dialysis. $^{1}$

## 46. A. Distal renal tubular acidosis

Patients in the neonatal intensive care unit can develop normocalcemic hypercalciuric nephrocalcinosis as a result of 1 of the following causes:

- Distal renal tubular disease
- Bartter syndrome
- Hyperprostaglandin E syndrome
- Cushing syndrome
- Chronic furosemide use
- Familial hypomagnesemia

The other answer options (hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatasia, subcutaneous fat necrosis, and Williams syndrome) are all associated with hypercalcemic hypercalciuric nephrocalcinosis.

## 47. B. Decreased serum bicarbonate

Type 2 renal tubular acidosis (RTA), also known as proximal RTA, results from a decrease in bicarbonate resorption in the proximal tubule. The high urinary loss of bicarbonate is associated with a high urine pH and leads to a decrease in serum bicarbonate with associated metabolic acidosis. $^{1}$

## 49. E. Ureteric bud

The pronephros develops and then regresses by 4 weeks' gestation. This is followed by the development of the mesonephros that gives rise to the mesonephric tubule and duct. The mesonephric duct (also known as the Wolffian duct) then forms into the ureteric bud, which branches and differentiates into the collecting ducts, renal pelvis, and ureter. At the same time, the metanephric mesenchyme is formed and ultimately differentiates into the nephrons. Renal agenesis is due to the failure of development of the ureteric bud. A schematic of the normal development of the kidney is shown in the figure. $^{1}$

1.  B. Alveolar/capillary hypoplasia

Classic (or "old") bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) from the pre-surfactant era is characterized by structural damage of normal pulmonary structures from mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity with airway squamous metaplasia, alveolar septal fibrosis, airway smooth muscle hypertrophy, and marked inflammation.¹

In contrast, a disruption of normal alveolar and vascular development with subsequent diffuse alveolar/capillary hypoplasia is the hallmark of new BPD. This reduction in alveolar development leads to clinically significant loss of surface area for gas exchange. Airway injury, inflammation, and fibrosis are usually milder in new versus old BPD.²³

2.  A. Commitment of the family

Lung transplantation may be a therapeutic option to prolong survival in neonates with inherited disorders of surfactant metabolism. The decision to proceed with lung transplantation is a complex one and includes the following considerations:

- Specific molecular defect
- Degree of illness and anticipated disease trajectory
- Absence of extrapulmonary organ dysfunction
- Ability to transport and remain near a pediatric lung transplant center
- The desire and commitment of the family

This final criterion is the most important factor in the decision to proceed with lung transplantation for an inherited disorder of surfactant metabolism.¹²

3.  C. Positive end-expiratory pressure

Functional residual capacity (FRC) represents the lung volume at the end of normal tidal ventilation and is determined by the balance between outward stretch of the thorax and inward recoil of the lung. Functional residual capacity is critical for oxygenation and must be optimized to improve oxygenation. In preterm neonates, the judicious use of positive end-expiratory pressure is most effective in establishing and maintaining FRC.¹²

4.  E. Volume-targeted ventilation

In volume-targeted ventilation modes, the peak inflating pressure required to deliver the targeted volume is dependent on lung compliance and, therefore, is higher when lung compliance is poor and decreases with improvement in lung compliance. This permits consistent tidal volume delivery at the lowest pressure and thereby avoids injurious overdistention. A Cochrane systematic review showed a decrease in death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (typical risk reduction of 0.73, 95% CI, 0.57–0.93) with volume-targeted ventilation versus pressure-limited ventilation.¹

5.  C. Promoting adsorption and spreading of surfactant

Surfactant, a surface-active substance produced in type II pneumocytes, decreases surface tension proportionally to alveolar size to prevent alveolar collapse at end expiration. The composition of surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids and protein, is critical to its function. Lipids are the most abundant component of surfactant (90%) and include phospholipids (saturated and unsaturated

phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, and others) and neutral lipids. Saturated phosphatidylcholine (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) represents 50% of surfactant and is the principal lipid responsible for the formation of the lipid monolayer and thereby reduction in surface tension. Surfactant also contains 4 surfactant proteins (SPs), 2 hydrophobic (SP-B and SP-C) and 2 hydrophilic (SP-A and SP-D). Surfactant protein B and SP-C are critical to the optimal dynamic behavior and function of surfactant and facilitate absorption and spreading of the phospholipid monolayer. Surfactant protein A and SP-D are collectins and are part of the host innate system. Surfactant protein A helps regulate surfactant expression and uptake, while SP-D regulates surfactant reuptake and recycling.¹

## 6. E. Ventilator dependence at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age

Permissive hypercapnia is a ventilation strategy used to decrease ventilator-induced injury in preterm neonates. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published investigating the benefits of permissive hypercapnia strategies in preterm neonates.

The first trial, a pilot trial in 49 preterm neonates, demonstrated a decreased need for mechanical ventilation in the intervention group.¹ The largest trial included 220 neonates with a birth weight of 501 to 1,000 g and demonstrated a decrease in ventilatory support at 36 weeks in the permissive hypercapnia group (1% vs 16%, P &lt; .01) with no adverse effect on severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), or survival without neurodevelopmental impairments at 18 to 22 months.² The third RCT had higher Paco₂ targets and did not show benefits of permissive hypercapnia in 65 very preterm neonates.³ Finally, a Cochrane review including 2 of the trials concluded there was no difference in the incidence of death, chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, severe IVH, or PVL.⁴ This conclusion was supported by a recent multicenter RCT in 359 neonates 23 to 28 weeks' gestation comparing Paco₂ targets of 55 to 65 mm Hg (days 1-3), 60 to 70 mm Hg (days 4-6), and 65 to 75 mm Hg (days 7-14) in the high target group versus Paco₂ targets of 40 to 50 mm Hg (days 1-3), 45 to 55 mm Hg (days 4-6), and 50 to 60 mm Hg (days 7-14) in the control group.⁵

## 7. A. Frameshift mutation (121ins2)

Surfactant protein B is critical to surfactant function and facilitates the adsorption of surfactant lipids to the air-liquid interface. Surfactant protein B is encoded by the SFTPB gene on chromosome 2. The most common mutation in individuals of Northern European descent is the frameshift mutation (121ins2). This mutation accounts for 60% to 70% of all the SFTPB alleles mutants identified to date.¹,²

Surfactant protein B deficiency is a severe autosomal recessive disorder characterized by respiratory distress of variable severity and diffuse lung disease on chest radiograph at birth. Progressive worsening of the respiratory status with possible transient improvement is typical. Death from respiratory failure most commonly occurs between 3 and 6 months of age. Lung transplantation is currently the only effective treatment option.³,⁴

# 8. E. Larger preterm neonates (&gt;1,000 g birth weight)

The use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in preterm neonates has been studied in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Kinsella and colleagues investigated the use of iNO in 793 preterm neonates with respiratory failure. They found no difference in the incidence of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the overall cohort. However, for neonates with birth weight greater than 1,000 g, iNO decreased the incidence of death or BPD from 59.6% to 29.8%.¹

Van Meurs and colleagues found a similar effect in a post hoc analyses of their RCT in 420 preterm neonates with respiratory failure. In this trial, iNO also decreased the rate of death or BPD among neonates greater than 1,000 g at birth (50% vs 69%, P = .03).²

# 9. C. Impaired alveolar development

Classic bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is due to injury to the immature lung from in utero infection and postnatal mechanical ventilation with high pressures and oxygen concentration. It is characterized by marked parenchymal and airway inflammation as well as airway squamous metaplasia, alveolar septal fibrosis, and airway smooth muscle hypertrophy.¹,²

In contrast, new BPD is secondary to the resuscitation of extremely immature lungs with subsequent disruption of normal alveolar and vascular development. The hallmark of new BPD is diffuse alveolar/capillary hypoplasia. It is characterized by less smooth muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis and less large and small airway metaplasia than "old" BPD.³,⁴

# 10. B. Blockage of adenosine receptors

Caffeine is an effective treatment for apnea of prematurity resulting in

- Stimulation of the medullary respiratory center
- Increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide
- Improved diaphragmatic contractility and airway function

Caffeine exerts its effects primarily via antagonism of adenosine A1 and A2 receptors in the brain. Secondary mechanisms include inhibition of phosphodiesterase with increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate as well and intracellular calcium release. These mechanisms are likely less important in the neonatal population because they require very high caffeine concentrations.¹,² In animal models, upregulation of the γ-amino butyric acid receptor has also been shown to be a mechanism of action of caffeine.³

Glucocorticoids have been shown to prevent or decrease the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) most likely secondary to their anti-inflammatory effect. This anti-inflammatory effect is primarily mediated by annexin A1 synthesis, resulting in decreased phospholipid A2 expression and thereby decreased production of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and leukotrienes. Other mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids include

- Suppression of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2
- Modulation of transcription and post-transcription regulation of surfactant components
- Stimulation of antioxidant production
- Enhanced adrenergic activity¹,²

## 12. B. It is secreted into the proximal tubule lumen and performs its action in the thick ascending loop of Henle, where it inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride.

Furosemide is a loop diuretic that exerts its action on the thick ascending loop of Henle where most tubular sodium is reabsorbed. Because loop diuretics are highly protein bound, they are minimally filtered at the glomerular level and are carried to the proximal tubule, where they are excreted into the lumen by organic acid pumps. Decreased renal blood flow and secretory processes reduce drug delivery and the diuretic effects of loop diuretics in preterm infants. Once secreted in the lumen, loop diuretics inhibit the reabsorption of sodium and chloride by binding to the sodium-potassium-chloride transporter. Another effect of furosemide is increase in prostaglandin production with subsequent vasodilatation and increase in renal blood flow.[1,2]

## 13. E. Reduction in births past 41 weeks' gestation

Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is diagnosed in neonates with respiratory distress born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid and for whom symptoms cannot be otherwise explained. MAS is characterized by hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis. While the incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid is 8% to 10% of term deliveries, MAS occurs in 1.5% of neonates born after 37 weeks' gestation. This represents a significant decrease from 5.7% in 1990. This decrease in the incidence of MAS is largely due to a marked decrease in the number of births occurring after 41 weeks' gestation.[1-3]

## 14. B. Gas volume

Given the small size of neonatal patients, a key parameter of the evaluation of a new ventilator for use in neonates is to understand how the delivered gas volume is measured and adjusted. Ventilators designed for general use often measure the delivered gas volume at the ventilator exit port, not at the airway opening. With this type of ventilator, the delivered volume can be grossly overestimated and underestimated despite applied correction to estimate circuit losses. $^{1}$

## 15. A. Attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung interstitial fibrosis

Therapeutic hypercapnia is performed by adding carbon dioxide to inspired gases to induce hypercapnia and differs from permissive hypercapnia, which occurs in the setting of a ventilated patient being managed with low minute ventilation. Unlike permissive hypercapnia, therapeutic hypercapnia allows for the independent investigation of hypercapnic acidosis. In experimental models, therapeutic hypercapnia has been shown to

- Attenuate measures of lung injury in models of high tidal volume-induced and endotoxin-induced lung injury.[1,2]
- Attenuate hyperoxia-induced fibrosis in neonatal mice.[3]
- Decrease neutrophil influx and inflammation.[1,2]
- Alter neutrophil adherence to pulmonary endothelial cells by decreasing the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 as well as the chemoattractant interleukin 8.[4]
- Decrease tumor necrosis factor α secretions in macrophages.[5]

Intermittent hypoxemia is characterized by brief episodes of hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Spo₂) drops and is most commonly defined as Spo₂ drops below 80%. Intermittent hypoxemia is common in preterm infants and is inversely correlated to gestational age and birth weight. It occurs in 50% of moderately preterm infants and 97% of extremely preterm infants. Infants born small for gestational age are at increased risk of IH. The natural progression of IH is characterized by a low incidence in the first week after birth followed by progressive increase between weeks 2 and 3 with IH peaking between 4 and 5 weeks after birth. Intermittent hypoxemia events then plateau or start to decrease during weeks 6 to 10 after birth.¹⁻⁴

## 17. D. Edi trigger is the minimum increase in electrical activity from the preceding trough that triggers the ventilator to designate the increase in electrical activity as a breath.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) allows for the synchronization of NIV to the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi), as measured via a specialized NAVA catheter placed in the distal esophagus. The Edi peak corresponds to the neural inspiratory effort, or respiratory drive, while the Edi minimum is a measure of the tonic activity of the diaphragm, an estimate of the effort needed to prevent alveolar de-recruitment at end expiration. The Edi trigger corresponds to the minimum increase in electrical activity from the preceding baseline that will trigger the ventilator. It is set by the clinician to recognize strong Edi signals as breaths and distinguish them from background noise.¹

## 18. A. Avoiding extreme flexion or extension of the neck and considering prone positioning

Apnea of prematurity (AOP) is common and is inversely correlated to gestational age. It affects almost all neonates less than 28 weeks' gestation and about 20% of neonates at 34 weeks' gestation.¹ Apnea of prematurity can persist beyond term and up to 44 weeks' gestation in some neonates.²,³

Some preventative measures have been shown to decrease the burden of AOP in preterm neonates. These include

- Avoidance of extreme flexion or extension of neck to maintain the patency of the upper airway⁴
- Maintenance of a stable thermal environment, as temperature fluctuations have been shown to result in apnea⁵
- Careful attention to the maintenance of nasal patency, including judicious nasal suctioning, use of heated humidified air, and use of appropriately sized nasal cannula
- Maintaining oxygen saturation within an appropriate target range (ie, 88%-94%), because of the hypoxic ventilatory depression present in preterm neonates

- Tachypnea associated with nasal flaring, grunting, and retractions (intercostal, subcostal, and suprasternal)
- Supplemental oxygen need typically less than 0.40

Symptoms typically resolve within 72 hours of birth.

Fluid in the interlobar fissure, bilateral edema, prominent pulmonary vasculature with increased perihilar markings, and lung hyperinflation are classic radiographic findings of TTN. These findings classically clear after 24 hours.¹,²

Establishment and maintenance of functional residual capacity (FRC) is critical to successful transition and effective ventilation at birth. Preterm neonates require assistance to establish and maintain FRC because of physiological disadvantages that include a compliant chest wall and weak musculature.¹ Continuous positive airway pressure and the application of positive end-expiratory pressure have been shown to facilitate lung recruitment, reduce atelectotrauma, and promote lung liquid resorption from the alveoli into the interstitium.²

- Brief tracheal catheterization with a feeding tube or other thin catheter. This is performed under direct visualization using Magill forceps.
- Administration of surfactant to the spontaneously breathing neonate.¹,²

In 220 neonates 26 to 28 weeks’ gestational age, this minimally invasive surfactant administration technique was found to result in

- Decrease in the number of newborns mechanically ventilated on days 2 or 3 after birth: 28% in the intervention group versus 46% in the standard group (P = .008)
- Reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation at any time (33% vs 73%; P &lt; .0001)
- Fewer days on mechanical ventilation and lower oxygen need therapy at 28 days³

## 23. D. 1989

Kurt von Neergaard is credited with making the first observation that the retractile force of the lung is dependent on the surface tension in the alveoli and that lowering surface tension could improve respiratory mechanics and should be studied in newborns. In the 1950s, several investigators elucidated the role of the alveolar lining layer in mediating surface tension, and the term pulmonary surfactant was coined by John Clements. In 1959, Avery and Mead made the observation that the lungs of neonates who died of hyaline membrane disease did not contain foam in their airway. This seminal discovery led to the understanding of surfactant deficiency as the cause of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Fujiwara and colleagues were the first to successfully treat preterm neonates with RDS with a modified natural surfactant. Surfactant was approved for the treatment of RDS by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1989.¹,²

## 25. E. 1994

Antenatal steroid administration to pregnant women with threatened delivery is now considered the single most effective intervention to decrease mortality and morbidity among neonates born preterm. The first randomized controlled trial of antenatal betamethasone for preterm delivery was performed by Liggins and Howie in 1972.¹ This trial was followed by several other trials that all consistently demonstrated significant benefits of antenatal steroid in preterm neonates as young as 24 weeks’ gestation. In these trials as well as later observational studies, antenatal steroid administration resulted in decreased mortality and morbidity including respiratory distress syndrome and intraventricular hemorrhage.²–⁴

Despite mounting evidence, it was not until 1994 that the National Institutes of Health recommended the use of antenatal steroids for women with threatened delivery between 24 and 34 weeks’ gestation.⁵

# 26. E. Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity

Early echocardiography is an important tool in the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in preterm neonates with severe respiratory distress syndrome and requiring high levels of ventilator support. Preterm neonates with PH may have the following echocardiographic findings:

- Right atrial enlargement
- Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Right ventricular dilation
- Pulmonary artery dilation
- Septal flattening

These qualitative findings have overall poor predictive value. The most utilized finding is the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity to estimate systolic pulmonary artery pressures (sPAP). Studies indicate that sPAP correctly identifies PH in 79% of patients but is poor in the prediction of PH severity. Further, sPAP cannot be consistently obtained (only in about 61% of cases).¹

# 27. C. Compared to hydrocortisone, dexamethasone is 25 to 50 times more potent.

The use of glucocorticoids, and particularly dexamethasone, has been extensively studied for the treatment and prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Dexamethasone, a long-acting steroid with a half-life of 36 to 54 hours, has almost exclusive glucocorticoid effects with minimal mineralocorticoid effects. It is 25 to 50 times more potent than hydrocortisone and has been shown to improve pulmonary function, facilitate extubation, and decrease the incidence of BPD among preterm infants. However, it is associated with many adverse effects preventing its routine use. Those include hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, growth failure, gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation, and chronic suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Most concerning are the long-term adverse effects of dexamethasone use on neurodevelopmental outcomes.¹,²

Two recent meta-analyses of systemic corticosteroids for the prevention of BPD in preterm infants concluded that dexamethasone reduces the risk of BPD but that there is uncertainty with regard to optimal agent and treatment regimens, including when, how much, and for how long.³,⁴ Hydrocortisone is an attractive alternative to dexamethasone because relative adrenal insufficiency is common in preterm infants. In the PREMILOC trial, low-dose hydrocortisone, administered during the first 10 postnatal days, resulted in increased rate of survival without BPD (51% vs 60%, P = .04) in 523 preterm neonates less than 28 weeks' gestation.⁵ While there was no overall increase in sepsis rate, subgroup analysis indicated an increased risk of sepsis in infants 24 to 25 weeks' gestation. There was no effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 2 years.⁶

Furosemide resistance can occur via multiple mechanisms including

- Distal tubular cell hypertrophy in response to chronic increase in sodium concentrations delivered to the distal tubule. The addition of a thiazide diuretic, 0.5 to 1.0 hour prior to furosemide administration, will inhibit distal tubule sodium reabsorption.
- Altered furosemide oral absorption.
- Concomitant use of nonsteroidal drugs that inhibit prostaglandins and blunt the response to loop diuretics.
- Decreased delivery to the thick ascending loop of Henle (ie, hypoalbuminemia, decreased renal blood flow).

29. B. When a neonate is breathing supplemental oxygen, the sigmoidal hemoglobin-oxygen relationship is less consistent at higher oxygen saturations, with the $\mathrm{Pao}_2$ being higher than expected.

The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve describes the relationship between arterial oxygen saturation $(\mathrm{Sao}_2)$ and arterial partial pressure of oxygen $(\mathrm{Pao}_2)$. The predictable relation between $\mathrm{Pao}_2$ and $\mathrm{Sao}_2$ is lost at high oxygen saturations when supplemental oxygen is used. Under these circumstances, $\mathrm{Pao}_2$ may be higher than anticipated and increase in dissolved free oxygen. Free radical production will also occur. Therefore, measurements of $\mathrm{Pao}_2$ should be performed to avoid hyperoxia, along with avoiding high $\mathrm{Sao}_2$ levels in neonates requiring supplemental oxygen. $^1$

30. B. Chorioamnionitis can induce lung maturation and decrease respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), but it may also lead to symptoms of diffuse pneumonia presenting as respiratory distress.

Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are often exposed (50% of patients) to chorioamnionitis, which may be clinically unrecognized. $^{1}$ The resultant inflammation can result in decrease in the incidence of RDS by promoting lung maturation primarily via increased amounts of surfactant. $^{2}$ Interestingly, while growth-restricted neonates experience chronic stress, a decrease in the incidence of RDS among this population has not been observed. This is presumably secondary to other underlying mechanisms such as variable degrees of lung hypoplasia and/or lung structural abnormalities as contributing causes of respiratory distress. $^{3}$

On the flip side, chorioamnionitis and the subsequent inflammation can present as diffuse pneumonia that may clinically mimic RDS but respond poorly to exogenous surfactant. $^{4,5}$

31. C. The point at which the NAVA level is at a plateau phase in which the peak inspiratory pressure and tidal volumes do not increase further, as a result of downregulation of electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi)

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) allows for the synchronization of NIV to the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi), as measured via a specialized NAVA catheter placed in the distal esophagus. When using NAVA ventilation modes, it is important to understand the following terminology:

---

<!-- Page 610 -->

Answers

- The Edi peak: a measure of the neural inspiratory effort, or respiratory drive
- The Edi minimum: a measure of the tonic activity of the diaphragm, or the effort to prevent alveolar de-recruitment at end expiration
- The Edi trigger: the minimum increase in electrical activity from the preceding baseline that will trigger the ventilator (set by the clinician to recognize strong Edi signals as breath and distinguish them from background noise)
- NAVA level: a conversion factor that converts the Edi signal into a proportional pressure

When initiating NAVA ventilation, it is important to titrate the NAVA level to achieve optimal respiratory unloading. Respiratory unloading is achieved once a plateau phase is reached, where additional titration of the NAVA level does not result in further increases in peak inspiratory pressures and tidal volume. Increases in NAVA levels beyond this breaking point result in downregulation of Edi.¹

## 32. C. Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation may have benefit in reducing extubation failure compared with CPAP.

Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a method of noninvasive respiratory support that combines continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with ventilator breaths. It can be synchronized (SNIPPV) or non-synchronized (NIPPV). Initial trials indicated that SNIPPV reduced the risk of extubation failure by 33% compared with CPAP alone with a number needed to treat of 3.¹⁻⁴ A Cochrane review that included 5 trials using SNIPPV, 2 trials using NIPPV, and 1 trial using both methods concluded that NIPPV decreased extubation failure and need for reintubation within 48 hours to 1 week with no effect on bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality.⁵

## 33. C. Using a longer inflation time

Establishment and maintenance of functional residual capacity (FRC) is critical to successful transition and effective ventilation at birth. Several methods have been shown to be effective in helping preterm neonates establish FRC after birth, including

- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and positive end-expiratory pressure have been shown to facilitate lung recruitment, reduce atelectotrauma, and promote lung liquid resorption.¹
- Sustained inflation (SI) strategies where a prolonged inflation time is used to establish FRC has been studied in both experimental models and neonates. A meta-analyses including 4 randomized controlled trials concluded that SI decreases the need for mechanical ventilation at 72 hours but does not affect bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death. In addition, an increase in the number of neonates requiring treatment for patent ductus arteriosus was noted.² A recent Cochrane review of SI versus standard inflation concluded that SI does not decrease mortality, need for intubation, need for or duration of respiratory support, or BPD.³ More concerning, a recent large randomized controlled trial was stopped early due to excess mortality in the SI group.⁴ At this time the effects of SI on respiratory outcomes in preterm neonates require further study and the use of SI is not recommended in routine clinical practice.

## 34. D. Lucinactant (Surfaxin)

Third-generation surfactants are synthetic surfactants containing proteins capable of mimicking the properties of surfactant protein (SP) B and SP-C. Two such surfactants have been developed: recombinant SP-C (Venticute) and lucinactant. Lucinactant is the only one that has been studied in neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It contains a 21-amino acid peptide, $\mathrm{KL}_4$, that reproduces the function of SP-B. While lucinactant has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing mortality associated with RDS, it was not found to be superior to animal-derived surfactants. $^{1-3}$

## 35. E. To deliver HFNV, a machine that provides high-frequency ventilation invasively can be used to alter the frequency and amplitude of pulsations.

High-frequency nasal ventilation (HFNV) is a form of noninvasive respiratory support where small tidal volumes are delivered at high frequency, eliminating the need for synchronization. Similar to continuous positive airway pressure, HFNV can be used as a primary mode of noninvasive respiratory support in spontaneously breathing neonates. During HFNV, a ventilator that provides invasive high-frequency ventilation is used, allowing for adjustments in frequency and amplitude of the pulsations, as well as base pressure, based on the neonate's needs. $^{1}$

In experimental lamb models, HFNV has been shown to support normal inspiratory dilator muscle activity without increasing inspiratory constrictor activity, which has been shown to occur during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. $^{2,3}$

## 36. C. A randomized controlled trial has shown that caffeine therapy can reduce the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Methylxanthines inhibit adenosine receptors in the brain and are effective in the treatment of apnea of prematurity (AOP). The use of methylxanthines leads to

- Improved respiratory drive
- Increased minute ventilation and carbon dioxide sensitivity
- Decreased hypoxic ventilator depression
- Improved diaphragmatic contractility
- Improved lung compliance due to weak diuretic effect

Caffeine citrate has largely replaced theophylline because of broader therapeutic range and longer half-life. Caffeine therapy is recommended for all preterm neonates less than 28 to 32 weeks' gestation depending on center. $^{2,3}$ Caffeine has been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia as well as the need for medical or surgical treatment of patent ductus arteriosus. $^{4}$

In addition to caffeine therapy, the use of noninvasive positive airway pressure support after extubation is recommended. Administration of positive pressures splints the airway and has been shown to decrease extubation failure and apnea. $^{5}$ This can be most effectively achieved using continuous positive airway pressure or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. High-flow nasal cannula is also an option in larger

## 37. E. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen recovered from airway secretions in patients who have VAP by tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage methods.

The use of tracheal aspirates to help establish the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is controversial. Tracheal aspirates do not allow for the distinction between colonization and pneumonia and have been shown to have low sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of VAP.¹ However, in neonates suspected of having VAP, the identification of the organisms colonizing the airway may be helpful in guiding antibiotic therapy.

In a cohort study, gram-negative organisms were identified in 94% of tracheal aspirates obtained in neonates diagnosed with VAP, with Staphylococcus aureus accounting for about 25% of cases.² Of note, multiple organisms were identified in 58% of patients. In contrast, when using bronchoalveolar lavage, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 62% of patients and multiple organisms were identified in only 16.7% of patients.³

## 38. A. If the lungs show overinflation, one or more of the following settings can be decreased: CPAP, peak inspiratory pressure of sinusoidal breaths, and/or pulsatile rate.

Similar to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), high-frequency nasal ventilation (HFNV) can be used to support spontaneously breathing neonates noninvasively. During HFNV, small tidal volumes are delivered at high frequency by a ventilator that usually provides invasive high-frequency ventilation. Adjustments in frequency and amplitude of the pulsations, as well as base pressure, are made based on the neonates' needs. Based on multiple studies and clinical experience, the following guidelines for the use of HFNV have been developed:

- Typical CPAP level: 5 to 7 cm H₂O (can be titrated up to 10).
- Recommended rate: 300 to 480 breaths per minute. Lower frequencies should be considered in neonates with nonhomogeneous lung disease, with air-trapping, or for whom increase in amplitude fails to improve ventilation.
- Sinusoidal breaths: 6 to 12 breaths per minute.
- Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) titrated to see chest wall movement.

In cases of lung overinflation, one or more of the following settings can be decreased: CPAP, the PIP of sinusoidal breaths, and/or pulsatile rate. Conversely, these parameters can be increased when underinflation of the lung is observed.

In neonates with fraction of inspired oxygen requirement greater than 0.4, an assessment of lung volume is recommended with subsequent increase in CPAP for suboptimal inflation or, conversely, decrease in CPAP if air trapping and overinflation is observed.¹

# 40. E. The volume of distribution of caffeine increases linearly with increasing weight.

Caffeine is commonly used in the neonatal intensive care unit and has been shown to be effective for the treatment of apnea of prematurity. Caffeine is metabolized in the liver via a N7-demethylation process that matures with increasing gestational age and postmenstrual age. In addition, caffeine metabolism has been shown to be higher in girls. In very low birth weight preterm infants, both caffeine clearance and the volume of distribution of caffeine are significantly lower, increasing linearly with increasing weight.¹,²

# 41. D. Type 2 malformations account for 20% of cases and are multicystic with cyst size greater than 2 cm.

Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) occurs with an incidence of 1 in 10,000 and represent 40% of all congenital lung malformations. They more typically occur in the lower lobes and there is no right or left predilection. Most CPAMs are diagnosed prenatally.

The classic classification of CPAM includes 5 subtypes.

- Type 0 (rare): limited to the upper tracheobronchial tree
- Type 1 (70% of cases): macro-cystic (cyst size &gt;2 cm); may have a dominant single cyst or multiple cysts
- Type 2 (20%): multicystic with cyst size greater than 2 cm
- Type 3 (10%): microcystic adenomatoid solid without cystic elements; can be associated with other anomalies and carries a worse prognosis
- Type 4 (rare): hamartomatous malformation of the distal acini with peripheral cysts

Some authors recommend the use of a more clinically applicable classification into microcystic (&lt;5 mm cysts) or macro-cystic (≥5 mm cysts).¹

Some of the clinical features of the neonate described in the vignette are consistent with a diagnosis of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN).¹,²

- Presence of risk factors: Cesarean delivery without labor, delivery before 39 weeks’ gestation, and small for gestational age status.
- Onset of symptoms shortly after birth, but her need for escalating respiratory support with high oxygen requirement is suggestive of another pathophysiological process as the cause of respiratory distress. While neonates with TTN can have an oxygen requirement, it is typically less than 0.4.

## 45. C. Octreotide can be administered along with a combination of medium-chain triglyceride formula and parenteral nutrition.

Chylothorax can complicate the postoperative course of neonates requiring cardiac surgery. The principles of management of neonatal chylothorax include drainage of the effusion for diagnosis and symptom relief, nutritional support, octreotide, and, in some cases, surgical management.¹,²

Nutritional management may involve periods of "NPO" to reduce lymphatic flow as well as the use of formula containing medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that are directly absorbed. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is the most commonly used pharmacological agent in the management of chylothorax. Octreotide causes mild splanchnic vasoconstriction and decrease in hepatic blood flow, thereby decreasing lymphatic flow.² While it is commonly used, there are no randomized controlled trials to support its use in the neonatal population. Immune prophylaxis with intravenous immunoglobulin may be considered because of the high risk of nosocomial infections in neonates with chylothorax.³,⁴

A stepwise approach starting with an MCT formula and escalating to NPO with total parenteral nutrition and octreotide depending on response may be helpful in avoiding the need for surgery.² Response to medical management is typically observed for 2 to 4 weeks before considering surgical options.

Monitors measuring pulse oximetry (Spo₂, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation) are routinely used in clinical practice. These monitors display a percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen that is calculated from the ratio between red wavelengths and infrared wavelengths. They have an inherent bias ranging from 2% to 5%. Monitors using signal extraction technology have a better sensitivity and specificity in addition to fewer missed events and alarms. Some monitors use more than 2 wavelengths, allowing for the measurements of hemoglobin, methemoglobin, and carboxyhemoglobin, in addition to Spo₂.¹,²

between 32 weeks' gestation and 34 weeks' gestation if the infant is no longer experiencing apneas requiring interventions over the previous 5 to 7 days.³ Recent data suggest that prolonged caffeine therapy decreases the intermittent hypoxemia burden in preterm infants 34 to 37 weeks' gestation. The long-term effect is unclear at this time.⁴

There is no conclusive evidence to support the use of anti-reflux medication in infants with AOP. Doxapram is another possible pharmacological intervention but is rarely used because of serious side effects including irritability, hypertension, and decreased cerebral blood flow. Other therapeutic options, such as red blood cell transfusion, increase inspiratory carbon dioxide concentration, and olfactory or mechanosensory stimulation requires further studies.

48. B. Preliminary studies suggest that neonates who received intratracheal administration of budesonide with surfactant (beractant) compared with surfactant alone required lower mean airway pressures for ventilation and had lower oxygen index and lower $\mathrm{PCO}_2$ during the first 24 to 48 hours.

Inhaled corticosteroids have been studied in the treatment and prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm neonates and infants because this route of therapy offers the theoretical advantage of high local delivery of the drug without the adverse effects observed with systemic administration. However, inconsistent and overall poor drug delivery to the lung has hampered progress in this area. As such, new methods of delivering inhaled corticosteroid using surfactant as a vehicle have been developed. Preliminary studies indicate that neonates who receive intratracheal budesonide with surfactant require lower mean airway pressure and have lower oxygen index and $\mathrm{PCO}_2$ 24 to 48 hours after administration compared with neonates who received surfactant alone. Further, neonates in the budesonide group were also more likely to be extubated in the first week and to survive without BPD (82% vs 58%). A transient increase in blood pressure was observed with budesonide administration, but the blood pressure remained within reference range for age. There was no effect of budesonide exposure on neurocognitive outcomes at age 2 years.¹²

49. E. Medications such as diuretics and inhalation agents are not currently recommended as standard therapy in the management of TTN.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn is caused by a delay in fetal lung fluid clearance. It is characterized by onset of symptoms shortly after birth including tachypnea, nasal flaring, grunting, and retraction and in some cases oxygen requirement (typically fraction of inspired oxygen is &lt; 0.4). Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a self-limiting disorder of delayed transition, and symptoms commonly resolve within 72 hours. Treatment is supportive. The use of diuretics, inhaled racemic epinephrine, and inhaled $\beta_2$-adrenergic agonists requires further study and is not recommended at this time.¹²

For newborns with respiratory distress syndrome, initiation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should follow the general following guidelines¹:

- Ventilator rate: 40 breaths per minute
- Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP): 2 to 4 cm $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ above PIP on manual positive pressure ventilation
- Positive end-expiratory pressure: 4 to 6 cm $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$

## 51. A. Tidal volume can vary with changes in lung compliance, particularly after surfactant administration, resulting in inadvertently large tidal volume delivery and lung injury.

Pressure-controlled ventilation is a commonly used mode of ventilation in neonates. In pressure-limited ventilation, the peak inspiratory pressure is set and the volume delivered to the lungs will vary depending on compliance. Advantages of pressure-limited ventilation include a decreased effect of endotracheal tube leak and improved intrapulmonary gas distribution because of decelerating flow patterns. Disadvantages of pressure-limited volume ventilation include variable tidal volume delivery with risks of hyperventilation in situations of improved compliance (ie, post-surfactant) and volutrauma. $^{1-3}$

## 52. D. Meta-analysis of the 4 main trials favored SI for the outcome of mechanical ventilation within 72 hours after birth.

The use of sustained inflation (SI) in the delivery room has been extensively studied in experimental models. Observational studies have indicated that SI is feasible and safe in neonates, and subsequent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of SI compared with standard inflations have been published. In a meta-analysis of the 4 main RCTs, SI was found to decrease the need for mechanical ventilation at 72 hours but not rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death. Further, there was an increase in the number of neonates requiring treatment for patent ductus arteriosus who received SI. $^{1}$ However, results from a recent clinical trial have raised some concerns regarding the safety of SI in extremely preterm neonates. The trial was stopped early due to excess mortality among the SI group. $^{2}$ The most recent Cochrane review of SI versus standard inflation concluded that SI does not result in decreased mortality, need for intubation, need for or duration of respiratory support, or BPD. $^{3}$

## 54. C. In lymphoscintigraphy, a radioisotope is injected into the webs between a neonate’s fingers and toes, with the potential to identify aplasia, hypoplasia, and dysplasia of the lymphatic vessels.

Diagnostic imaging may be indicated in neonates with chylothorax to identify a cause and visualize the source of lymphatic leakage. Several imaging modalities are available.

- Conventional lymphography provides the best anatomical details of the lymphatic vessels but is technically challenging in neonates because it requires direct cannulation of the lymphatic vessels.¹
- Intranodal lymphography also provides good visualization of the lymphatic system but involves injection of ethiodized oil in a lymph node under ultrasonographic guidance and is typically performed under general anesthesia.²
- Magnetic resonance imaging lymphangiography, while noninvasive, is best at evaluating nodes and has poor resolution for the evaluation of the lymph vessels.³
- Lymphoscintigraphy is feasible in neonates but has a much lower resolution than conventional lymphography. It is performed by injecting a radioisotope into the webs between a neonate’s fingers and toes and may provide information on lymph vessels aplasia, hypoplasia, or dysplasia and can identify the lymphatic duct.⁴,⁵

These techniques require expertise and are generally not routinely available.

Patients with $ABCA3$ deficiency have variable clinical presentation including

Inositol is an essential nutrient that has been shown to promote surfactant maturation. To date, 4 small randomized controlled trials have been published investigating the efficacy and safety of inositol in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.

## 59. B. Increases alveolar carbon dioxide elimination

Permissive hypercapnia is a ventilator strategy using low tidal volume and minute ventilation to decrease ventilator-induced lung injury. During permissive hypercapnia, higher $\mathrm{Paco}_2$ values are accepted.

During permissive hypercapnia, higher alveolar carbon dioxide level results in increased alveolar carbon dioxide elimination because carbon dioxide elimination is proportional to $\mathrm{Paco}_2$ and alveolar ventilation. Other beneficial effects of hypercapnia and hypercapnic acidosis include

- Improved ventilation-perfusion mismatch
- Increased unloading of oxygen to the tissue secondary to a right shift of the oxygen dissociation curve (Bohr effect)
- Stabilization of the respiratory drive with decrease in apnea events
- Increased cardiac output despite decrease in cardiac contractility
Hypercapnia also has some deleterious effects including
- Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
- Small reduction in alveolar oxygen concentration $^{1}$

Inhibition of sodium and chloride transport in the distal convoluted tubule represents the primary mechanism of action of thiazide diuretics.

A synergistic effect is observed when thiazide diuretics are administered with loop diuretics. $^{1,2}$

61. E. Continuous pulse oximetry should be used before weaning oxygen and can be modified to spot checks when weaning daytime oxygen.

Home oxygen therapy may be necessary for preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Typically, infants with BPD will go home on flows ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 L/min with a goal of maintaining oxygen saturation (SPO₂) at or greater than 95% to 98%. Infants on higher flows, or requiring sildenafil in addition to nasal cannula oxygen, are at high risk for right-sided heart failure dysfunction and hospital readmission. Continuous pulse oximetry is used to monitor SPO₂ before weaning oxygen and can be modified to spot checks when weaning daytime oxygen. Strategies used to wean home oxygen vary widely. In general, adherence to the following principles is recommended:

- Discontinuation of diuretics prior to nasal cannula wean, if applicable.
- Scheduled, slow wean of daytime nasal cannula flow (ie, 0.1 L/min every month), until discontinued.
- Once off daytime oxygen, wean nighttime oxygen using a similar strategy.²

63. A. This may be a presentation of severe transient tachypnea of the newborn with retained lung fluid, which may be associated with low surfactant levels.

Many factors contribute to the severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm neonates. Protective factors include administration of antenatal steroids as well as conditions that induce lung maturation such as chorioamnionitis.

Conversely, many factors can either contribute to the RDS picture or represent alternative causes of respiratory distress. Those include

- Variable degrees of lung hypoplasia, such as that observed in growth-restricted neonates.
- Pulmonary hypertension.
- Inflammation and infection.
- Retained fetal lung fluid. In experimental models, delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid has been shown to contribute to the severity of RDS in preterm monkeys.¹ In addition, low levels of surfactant have been found in neonates with severe transient tachypnea of the newborn.²
- Ventilator-induced lung injury.
- Failure of respiratory drive with apnea.³,⁴

64. B. 25% to 35%

Preterm neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension (PH). The presence of PH increases the risk of mortality and morbidity among these patients. Retrospective studies suggest an incidence of BPD-associated PH of 25% to 37%.¹,²

65. A. Several trials of sustained inflation are ongoing and may provide further information on the potential effect of SI on outcomes and which methods may be most optimal.

The use of sustained inflation (SI) in the delivery room is not currently recommended for routine clinical practice. Results from the recently published Sustained Aeration for Infant Lungs trial have raised some concerns regarding the safety of SI in preterm neonates. This 18-center, international trial enrolled extremely preterm neonates (23–26 weeks’ gestation) and the intervention consisted of 2 SIs (maximal peak pressure of 25 cm H₂O and inflation time of 15 seconds). The trial was stopped early because of a significant increase in mortality at less than 48 hours after birth: 7.4% in the SI group versus 1.4% in the standard resuscitation group (adjusted risk difference, 5.6% [95% CI, 2.1% to 9.1%]; P = .002).¹

Three additional multicenter randomized controlled trials enrolling extremely preterm neonates are currently ongoing and may shed more light on the risks and benefits of SI in the delivery room.

66. D. Type II pneumocytes initiate surfactant production typically at around 26 weeks’ gestational age.

Congenital lung abnormalities have an estimated incidence of 1 in 10,000 and can occur throughout lung development. Lung development occurs in 5 stages.

- Embryonic stage (0–7 weeks): formation of the lung bud and conducting airways (trachea, lobar, and segmental and subsegmental bronchi)
- Pseudoglandular stage (7–17 weeks): branching morphogenesis with formation of 20 generations of airways, terminal bronchioles, and closure of the pleuroperitoneal folds
- The canalicular stage (16 to 23–27 weeks): terminal branching, respiratory bronchioles and establishment of the early air-blood interface, and differentiation of type II pneumocytes with emergence of lamellar bodies
- The saccular stage (24–28 to 36–38 weeks): saccule formation; surfactant production in type II pneumocytes at around 26 weeks’ gestation
- The alveolar stage (approximately 36 weeks–2 years): formation of the terminal alveoli, secondary inter-saccular, and inter-ductal septation with exponential increase in the lung surface area for gas exchange¹

Inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to improve respiratory function via multiple mechanisms, including

- Decrease in ventilation-perfusion mismatch secondary to decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary vasodilation

- Decreased oxidant stress
- Protection against surfactant dysfunction
- Restoration of more normal patterns of angiogenesis and parenchymal growth in the immature lung¹–⁶

## 68. E. Relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter

Caffeine has a wide therapeutic range, and dosing regimens vary by centers. The dosing regimen described in the vignette has been shown to lead to a therapeutic level in 70% of patients.¹ Caffeine decreases lower gastroesophageal sphincter pressure and increases reflux episodes, independently of plasma concentration.²,³

With increasing caffeine levels, signs of caffeine toxicity may include hypertonia, sweating, tachycardia, cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and creatine kinase elevation. Serious caffeine toxicity is not observed until levels reach 40 to 50 mg/L.⁴

## 69. B. Lipases

Surfactant is an important therapeutic consideration in the treatment of neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It is most effective when administered early, before the onset of lung injury. Lung injury can affect surfactant function via several mechanisms, including¹

- Inactivation by environmental exposure such as oxidants
- Degradation by lipases
- Conversion to inactive structural forms
- Inhibition of function by plasma proteins and lipids as well as inflammatory products
- Altered synthesis by alveolar type 2 cell secondary to circulating cytokines

## 70. A. An association between TTN and subsequent development of asthma has been described, with potential increased risk if the delivery was via cesarean.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a self-resolving disorder due to delay in fetal lung fluid clearance. Treatment is supportive and symptoms typically resolve within 48 to 72 hours. In rare cases, tachypnea persists for 1 week or more. Development of persistent pulmonary hypertension has also been described in severe cases, also called "malignant" TTN.

Studies have suggested a link between TTN and later risk of asthma, possibly due to underlying genetic predisposition. This risk is higher in neonates via cesarean.¹⁻³

## 71. B. Preterm neonates have enhanced sensitivity of the respiratory control system to inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, that can lead to apnea.

Apnea of prematurity (AOP) is common and incidence is inversely correlated to gestational age, affecting 97% of neonates less than 28 weeks' gestation and about 20% of neonates at 34 weeks' gestation.¹ It can

persist beyond term and up to 44 weeks' gestation in some neonates.²³ Preterm neonates are at risk of AOP because of the developmental immaturity of several mechanisms involved in control of breathing and maintenance of airway patency.

While AOP is classically classified as central, obstructive, and mixed, it most likely represents a continuum of events, with central apnea having an obstructive component and vice versa. Pharyngeal wall instability, excessive neck flexion or extension, and nasal obstruction have been implicated in the pathophysiology of obstructive apnea. Central apnea is characterized by the absence of chest wall motion with no evidence of obstruction to airflow.⁴

The underlying mechanisms of central apnea include

- Enhanced sensitivity of the respiratory control system to inhibitory neurotransmitters
- Hypoxic ventilatory depression secondary to increased peripheral chemoreceptor sensitivity in the carotid bodies
- Impaired hypercapnic ventilatory response and apnea threshold only slightly below the eupnea threshold
- Exaggerated laryngeal chemoreflex that may result in apnea
- Increased amount of active sleep with associated generalized inhibition of skeletal muscle activity⁵⁶

## 72. A. Apnea is the main driver for IH in preterm infants.

Intermittent hypoxemia (IH), defined as episodic, brief desaturation events to hemoglobin oxygen saturation levels below 80%, is common in preterm infants. The main underlying mechanism of IH is apnea. The typical sequence of events progresses from apnea, followed by IH, and, if prolonged, bradycardia. It is important to note that in very preterm infants, IH can occur with apnea much shorter than the traditional definition of 15 to 20 seconds. With regard to an infant's well-being, both IH and bradycardia are more relevant outcome measures than apnea.

While apnea of prematurity is classically classified as central, obstructive, and mixed, it most likely represents a continuum of events, with central apnea having an obstructive component and vice versa.¹² Preterm infants are at increased for IH due to the combination of lung disease and immaturity with respiratory instability. The mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of IH in preterm infants include

- Impaired hypercapnic response
- An apneic Pco₂ threshold only 1 to 2 mm Hg below the eupneic threshold
- Paradoxical ventilatory depression in response to hypoxia until about 35 weeks' gestation
- Hyperexcitable carotid bodies
- Immature laryngeal chemoreflex³⁻⁵

Lung immaturity and injury both lead to low pulmonary reserves and further compound the problem.

- Stimulation of the medullary respiratory centers
- Increased carbon dioxide sensitivity
- Bronchodilation

74. D. With $V_T$ as the primary control variable, inflation pressure will fall as lung compliance improves and result in weaning of pressure.

In volume-targeted ventilation (VTV), the peak inspiratory pressure varies (based on compliance) to deliver a set tidal volume ($V_T$). As shown in a Cochrane meta-analysis, this has the advantage of avoiding excessive $V_T$ and minimizes the risk of volutrauma. Volume-targeted ventilation significantly decreases the risk of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia as well as the risk of pneumothorax when compared with pressure-limited ventilation.¹ In another meta-analysis, a decrease in the risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage was also observed.² Results from these meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution because of the wide range of methodologies and outcomes reported. Importantly, VTV is critically dependent on accurate $V_T$ measurement. In neonates, volume guarantee is the only volume-targeted mode that has been shown to achieve stable $V_T$ delivery resulting in decreased risk of hypocapnia.

75. D. Infants born preterm with history of AOP have been noted to have higher baseline heart rates and lower heart rate variability in the first several months after birth, which is similar to findings in infants who died of SIDS.

Preterm infants with a history of apnea of prematurity (AOP) have higher baseline heart rates and lower heart rate variability in the first several months after birth.¹ While similar findings have been noted in infants who died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), there is no direct evidence that AOP is causally related to SIDS. Studies indicate that a history of AOP does not predict SIDS or the occurrence of clinically significant post-discharge events, and the need for readmission.² The use of home monitoring in this setting has not been shown to reduce SIDS. In addition, AOP typically resolves around 44 weeks’ gestational age, while the highest incidence of SIDS is around 47 weeks’ postmenstrual age. Based on this evidence, AOP and SIDS are not considered related disorders.²

76. B. Asynchrony during noninvasive ventilation has the potential for adverse effects of upper airway constrictor muscle activation, increased mean airway pressure and oxygen requirements, and fluctuation in blood pressure and intracranial pressure.

Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been shown to decrease extubation failure in preterm neonates when compared with nasal continuous positive airway pressure.¹ In addition, with reports of decreased mortality and chronic lung disease,²,³ the use of NIPPV has increased in recent years.

One of the main disadvantages of NIPPV includes the lack of synchronization, which may lead to important adverse effects.

## 77. C. When CPAP is used in preterm newborns at birth, the increase in $\mathrm{SPO}_2$ occurs more rapidly than those in nomograms.

Monitoring oxygen saturation ($\mathrm{SPO}_2$) in the delivery room is standard of care and should optimally be measured from the right hand for preductal $\mathrm{SPO}_2$ monitoring. The left hand is another option in cases where the right hand is not available and is preductal in greater than 80% of patients. According to manufacturer recommendation, sensors should be applied to the palm and dorsum of the hand, not the radial artery.

Oxygen saturation monitoring after birth is important in assisting clinicians in avoiding hypoxemia and hyperoxemia. Studies indicate that hyperoxemia in the postnatal period, even for a short period, alters whole-genome expression and negatively affects outcomes including increased risk of leukemia and cancer in childhood.¹,² Nomograms of expected $\mathrm{SPO}_2$ increase after birth have been published.³ It is important to recognize that neonates receiving continuous positive airway pressure support experience a more rapid increase in their $\mathrm{SPO}_2$.⁴,⁵

## 78. B. Separate suctioning equipment should be used for tracheal and oral secretions.

Bundles to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have been developed and many of the items beneficial in adults are not applicable to neonates. Neonatal VAP prevention bundles should include the following preventative strategies:

---

<!-- Page 625 -->

Respiratory
617

- Promote the use of noninvasive ventilation and assess daily for extubation readiness.
- Prevent unintentional extubation.
- Suction oropharynx prior to endotracheal tube adjustment.
- Change ventilator circuits when visibly soiled.
- Attention to ventilator tubing condensation (drain way from patient frequently).
- Use of separate suctioning equipment for tracheal and oral secretions. The use of in-line closed suctioning systems may provide additional benefits.
- Disinfect respiratory equipment after use.

While the practice of elevating the head of the bed is effective in adults and commonly used in neonates, its efficacy in preventing VAP requires further study.¹

Chronic use of furosemide is associated with

- Electrolyte disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis. Hypochloremic alkalosis is very prevalent among preterm infants receiving furosemide due to ongoing maturational processes.
- Hyperuricemia.
- Metabolic alkalosis.
- Nephrocalcinosis secondary to increased urinary calcium losses.
- Osteopenia.

In addition, preterm infants exposed to furosemide have an increased risk of sensorineural hearing loss. The risk of furosemide-associated ototoxicity can be mitigated by slow administration of intravenous doses as well as twice daily dosing.¹,²

## 80. C. The presence of chorioamnionitis, even when asymptomatic, can potentially lead to early maturation of the lungs, including increased surfactant level.

Exposure to chorioamnionitis is common in preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks’ gestation (50% of cases) and may be clinically silent.¹ The subsequent inflammation may result in early lung maturation, primarily via increased amounts of surfactant and ultimately decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).²

While exposure to RDS may lead to improved respiratory outcomes, it is also important to recognize the risk of diffuse pneumonia under these circumstances. Neonates with pneumonia are rarely recognized and rather are thought to have RDS. A poor response to exogenous surfactant may be a clue that an underlying pneumonia is confounding the RDS picture.

## 81. A. Congenital lobar emphysema is also known as congenital lobar hyperinflation and is caused by overdistension of one or more lobes, potentially causing severe respiratory compromise.

Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), or congenital lobar hyperinflation, describes the overdistension of one or more lung lobes. Multiple etiologies have been implicated in the development of CLE, including dysplastic cartilage formation in the canalicular stage, or endoluminal obstruction resulting in ball-valve effect in the saccular and alveolar stages of lung development. Congenital lobal emphysema is more common in the upper lobes and affects the left upper lobe in 40% to 50% of patients. The next most common location is the right middle lobe (30%–40% of cases). Congenital lobal emphysema can lead to significant respiratory compromise.

In contrast, congenital pulmonary airway malformations are more common in the lower lobes and do not have a right or left predilection. They are the most common type of congenital pulmonary abnormalities, representing 40% of all cases.

Bronchopulmonary sequestration is classified as intralobar (75% of cases) or extralobar and is characterized by anomalous systemic arterial blood supply (rather than pulmonary). It does not communicate with the tracheobronchial tree, has a pleural covering, and occurs most commonly in the lower lobes, particularly the left lower lobe.

Bronchogenic cysts occur in the mediastinum in 85% of patients. When they occur in the lung, they are typically located in the lower lobes with no right or left predilection. Bronchogenic cysts are thin-walled cysts with a bronchial epithelial lining, and they do not communicate with the bronchial tree.¹⁻³

## 82. A. Angiotensin-converting enzyme

While the etiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is multifactorial, genetic factors have been shown to account for 53% of the variance in the susceptibility for BPD.¹ Multiple candidate genes regulating inflammation, oxygen toxicity, cell injury and death, tissue repair, and infection have been studied in this context. Among those, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is of particular interest because increased ACE activity leads to fluid retention and may increase the risk of BPD. Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism, consisting of the presence (insertion, I) or absence (deletion, D) of a 287-bp Alu repeat in intron 16, leads to variable ACE activity with the D allele having increased activity. Kazzi and Quasney found that the presence of the D allele of ACE was associated with increased risk (47% vs 22%, P = .025) as well as increased severity of BPD in 120 neonates 1,250 g or less at birth and who survived to 36 weeks' postmenstrual age.² This finding was not, however, replicated in a study of 245 mechanically ventilated preterm neonates less than 1,250 g at birth. In this study, the ACE I/D polymorphism was not found to affect the development of BPD at 36 weeks' postconceptional age.³

## 83. A. It is likely that periods of hypoxia (ie, low tissue oxygenation) may lead to decreased respiratory drive in this infant, with reduced respiratory rate during those episodes.

Preterm infants are at increased for intermittent hypoxemia (IH) because of low pulmonary reserves, particularly low functional residual capacity (FRC), secondary to lung immaturity and/or injury. Functional residual capacity is inversely correlated with IH, with more rapid IH occurring in infants with lower FRC.¹ Periodic breathing and periodic apnea have been shown to be associated with higher frequency and severity of IH, likely secondary to progressive decrease in FRC volume. While inflammation can lead to respiratory depression because of increased prostaglandin production, IH itself may in turn be proinflammatory, resulting in a positive feedback loop.²,³

In addition, immaturity of the respiratory reflexes and responses further compounds the problem.

- Preterm infants demonstrate an impaired hypercapnic response, whereby the response to changes in Pco₂ is flat compared with older patients. In addition, the apneic Pco₂ threshold is only 1 to 2 mm Hg below the eupneic threshold, resulting in increased likelihood of IH.¹
- Preterm infants also have a paradoxical ventilatory depression in response to hypoxia, whereby hypoxemia results in decreased respiratory rate and decreased minute ventilation. Hypoxic ventilator depression persists until about 35 weeks' gestation.⁴,⁵
- Preterm infants also have hyperexcitable carotid bodies, which can lead to hyperventilation, decreased Pco₂ and apnea, and an immature laryngeal chemoreflex.⁶

## 84. E. In the CAP trial, there were lower rates of severe retinopathy of prematurity among the caffeine-treated group compared with the placebo group.

The Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP) trial is a large randomized placebo-controlled trial that investigated caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity in 2,006 preterm neonates 500 to 1,250 g birth weight.¹ Results from this trial demonstrated that caffeine therapy is safe in preterm neonates and results in

- Improved respiratory outcomes including the durations of endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and supplemental oxygen use. Neonates who received caffeine were less likely to be prescribed postnatal corticosteroids. In addition, the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia decreased from 46.9% to 36.3%. Benefits were most significant with early initiation of caffeine (within the first 72 hours after birth).
- Decreased need for pharmacological or surgical interventions for a patent ductus arteriosus.
- Decrease in the primary outcome of death or survival with major disability at 18 months' postmenstrual age. While this was no longer significant at the 5-year follow-up, neonates who received caffeine had improved motor coordination and visual perception.
- Decrease in the incidence of severe retinopathy of prematurity.
- Temporary slowing of weight gain with no difference after 4 weeks of therapy.¹⁻³

Accurate measurement of tidal volume (V_T) is critical for neonates treated using volume-targeted modes. The gold standard for measuring V_T changes is body plethysmography. However, it is impractical and has not been fully validated in neonates. Therefore, in most current ventilators, V_T is measured using pneumotachometers.¹,²

Removal of pleural fluid is necessary to confirm the presence of a chylothorax. A chylous pleural effusion is characterized as follows:

- White blood cell count typically greater than 1,000 cells/μL with greater than 80% mononuclear cells (ie, lymphocytes)
- Protein count similar to that of plasma
- Triglyceride level greater than 100 mg/dL (if enteral feeds)¹⁻³

Of note, chylous fluid is clear and serous in neonates who are "NPO" compared to creamy white in neonates who are feeding.

# 87. A. Assisted ventilation to optimize airway and alveolar patency

Exogenous surfactant administration is an effective therapy in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). A key to the success of surfactant therapy is homogeneous distribution over a large surface area of the lung. To optimize surfactant distribution, the factors should be considered.

- Volume of dose (Larger is better.)
- Rate of administration (Faster is better.)
- Ventilator assistance (to facilitate airway clearance and alveolar patency)
- Presence of lung liquid (to improve distribution)
- Positional maneuvers (to combat the effects of gravity)

# 88. A. Airway obstruction

Aspiration of meconium can lead to significant respiratory distress at birth because of multiple mechanisms, including

- Airway obstruction, either partially or completely, resulting in overdistention and atelectasis of the affected respiratory unit. This mechanism is prominent early in the course of the disease.
- Pulmonary vasoconstriction and persistent pulmonary hypertension, typically improving within 3 to 4 days. Pulmonary hypertension can occur because of chronic uterine hypoxia and post-acinar capillary hypertrophy or be secondary to hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis, and/or lung inflammation.
- Surfactant dysfunction, typically in the subacute and late phases of the disease.
- Chemical pneumonitis secondary to low meconium pH (7.1-7.2) as well as presence of enzymes and bile salts.
- Secondary infection. $^{1-3}$

# 89. C. Intubation followed by surfactant treatment has been shown to alter cerebral perfusion and electroencephalographic activity.

Direct instillation to the lungs of exogenous surfactant was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in 1989. Studies indicate that intubation and surfactant administration result in cerebral perfusion alterations as well as suppression of electroencephalographic activity. $^{1}$ Further, rapid changes in systemic blood flow are also observed. $^{2}$

With the success of noninvasive modes of respiratory support in preterm neonates, there has been an increasing interest in the development of minimally invasive methods of surfactant administration. These include administration of surfactant via

- A laryngeal airway mask. This technique is limited to neonates greater than $1,200\mathrm{g}$ and research on this technique is growing.
- Brief tracheal intubation using a thin catheter in spontaneously breathing neonates. A laryngoscope is used for direct visualization of the airway.
- Aerosolization. Studies are ongoing to determine the efficacy of nebulized surfactant.

Multiple types of surfactant are available for use in the United States, including animal-derived and third-generation synthetic surfactants. Lucinactant (Surfaxin) is the only synthetic surfactant studied in neonates. It contains a 21-amino acid peptide, $\mathrm{KL}_4$, that reproduces the function of surfactant protein B. While lucinactant has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing mortality associated with RDS, it was not found to be superior to animal-derived surfactants. $^{3-5}$

## 90. C. When attempted, the LISA procedure was able to be achieved in 94% of neonates without needing intubation.

The less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) procedure was performed in 224 neonates 23 to 27 weeks' gestation born between 2009 and 2011 at the Medical University of Vienna. The LISA procedure is based on the technique described by Kribs and colleagues, where brief tracheal intubation with a thin feeding catheter is performed under direct visualization using Magill forceps.¹ The procedure was performed at about 30 minutes after birth, in newborns on high-flow continuous positive airway pressure of 10 to 15 cm H₂O via a face mask, and after premedication with caffeine. The procedure was successful in 94% of neonates. In this cohort of patients, intubation was avoided in the first week in 65% of neonates, and 41% of these neonates were never intubated. Compared to historical control participants, neonates treated using the LISA method had²

- Increased survival (76% vs 64%, P &lt; .002)
- Decreased incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage and cystic periventricular leukomalacia
- Decreased need for supplementary oxygen at 28 days
- Higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus and retinopathy of prematurity

## 91. D. A pressure pop-off valve is an important component of an HFNC system, to avoid excessive pressures.

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is defined as flow rates greater than 1 L/min. Devices delivering HFNC include an oxygen blender, a gas heater, a humidifier, and a pop-off valve. The pop-off valve is a critically important safety feature, as supraphysiological distending pressures can occur at high-flow rates.¹ The pressure delivered via HFNC is less reliable than that delivered via continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and depends on the following factors:

- Size of the nasal prongs and degree of nares occlusion.²
- Whether or not the mouth is open.
- Flow rate. There is a linear relationship between flow rate and distending pressure.³ Wilkinson and colleagues determined that there is on average an increase of 0.8 cm H₂O for each increase in flow of 1 L/min if no leak is present.⁴

The use of heated, humidified HFNC has been studied as an initial mode of respiratory support and mostly as post-extubation support in preterm neonates. A recent meta-analysis of published trials indicates that HFNC has similar efficacy in preventing initial treatment failure as CPAP. As a post-extubation method, CPAP had fewer treatment failure than HFNC but was associated with more nasal trauma and pneumothoraxes. Data are lacking on the applicability of heated, humidified HFNC in extremely preterm neonates.⁵

## 92. C. Assist/control mode ventilation.

Assist/control (A/C) mode ventilation is a time-cycled, pressure-limited mode of ventilation where all spontaneous breaths are fully supported by the ventilator. In this mode of ventilation, the neonate controls the ventilator rate, and weaning is achieved by weaning the peak inspiratory pressure. A backup rate is generally set just below the neonate's spontaneous breathing rate in case of apnea. In A/C mode, tidal volume delivery is more uniform and work of breathing is lower.¹

## 93. E. The effect of lower Spo₂ targets on influencing IH events is most pronounced during the early postnatal period, before 2 weeks after birth.

Preterm neonates are at increased risk of intermittent hypoxemia (IH) secondary to lung immaturity/injury and respiratory instability. Intermittent hypoxemia has been shown to have a cumulative adverse effect of retinopathy of prematurity, neurodevelopmental impairments, and mortality. In addition to the goal of limiting IH, the following factors should be considered when deciding on hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Spo₂) targets:

- Low Spo₂ targets (ie, 85%–89%) result in increased short and long events, particularly in the first 2 weeks after birth.¹
- The pulse oximeter averaging time affects the number of events detected.² Averaging times longer than 2 seconds underestimate IH events of short duration and overestimate IH of long duration. Of note, the typical averaging times used in clinical oximeter are between 8 and 10 seconds to decrease alarm fatigue.

In addition, multiple studies have shown that health care professionals grossly underestimate the burden of events when compared with automated detection systems. In one study, health care professionals documented only 29% and 35% of events lasting more than 10 seconds and 20 seconds, respectively.³

## 94. A. Caffeine is likely to have reduced the frequency of apnea events in this patient compared to if she had received no treatment.

Caffeine therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of apnea events in preterm infants.¹ Caffeine exerts its effect by blocking adenosine A1 and A2 receptors and acts both centrally and peripherally to stimulate the medullary respiratory centers, increases carbon dioxide sensitivity, induces bronchodilation, and enhances diaphragmatic function.²,³

In addition, data from the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity trial indicate that caffeine is safe and results in

- Improved respiratory outcomes with reductions in duration of mechanical ventilation and rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (from 46.9%–36.3%).
- Decrease in the combined outcome of death or survival with major disability at 18 months' postmenstrual age. At the 5-year follow-up, children in the caffeine group had improved motor coordination and visual perception.⁴⁻⁶

The need for tracheostomy and continued PPV in the home setting is uncommon, with an overall incidence of approximately 2% among preterm infants.¹ The risk increases to 10% to 14% among infants with congenital airway malformations. Most infants (97%) requiring a tracheostomy placement for prolonged PPV need are weaned off PPV by age 5 years, with a median time of 2 years.²

96. C. Opiate treatment for sedation has been associated with increased risk of VAP.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious complication of mechanical ventilation in neonates. Diagnostic criteria in the neonatal population overlap with other conditions, and as a result, the diagnosis of VAP is subjective in many cases.¹ The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for the diagnosis of VAP in neonates include²

- Radiographic criteria: new or progressive infiltrate and persistent infiltrate, consolidation, cavitation, or pneumatoceles
- Clinical criteria of worsening gas exchange
- At least 3 of the following items: temperature instability; leukopenia, leukocytosis, or left shift; changes in the secretion pattern; apnea or increase in work of breathing; abnormal lung auscultation; and bradycardia or tachycardia

Of note, in its most current recommendations, the CDC defines ventilator-associated events as increase in fraction of inspired oxygen 0.25 or greater or mean airway pressure 4 cm H₂O or greater over baseline for at least 2 days.

The following risk factors have been found to be associated with the development of VAP³,⁴:

- Low birth weight
- Need for prolonged mechanical ventilation
- Sedation with opiates
- Frequent suctioning and reintubation
- A history of bloodstream infection
- Steroid use

97. B. One consideration for surgical repair, even in asymptomatic patients, is that complications including pneumonia or infection of the cystic elements may occur.

The treatment of congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) depends on whether or not the patient is symptomatic. Patients with antenatal presentations complicated by hydrops or very large CPAM should be referred to centers that can provide fetal surgery and/or have expertise with the postnatal evaluation and management of CPAM. Acutely symptomatic patients require surgical intervention in the newborn period. Asymptomatic patients can be treated expectantly with plan for elective diagnostic study (chest tomography with contrast) for surgical planning. Resection of the lesion is most commonly performed during the first year after birth. Observation alone in asymptomatic patients remains controversial because of the risk of infection, air leak, and malignancy. Open resection using a thoracotomy or thoracoscopic lobectomy are both an option in the surgical treatment of these patients.¹⁻³

98. D. Small and large for gestational age neonates are at increased risk of developing TTN.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a common cause of neonatal respiratory distress. It affects 10% of neonates born at 33 to 34 weeks' gestation, 5% of neonates born at 35 to 36 weeks' gestation, and less than 1% of all term neonates. Risk factors for TTN include¹

100. B. Spontaneous breaths in excess of 32 breaths per minute will not be supported by the ventilator.

Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is a time-cycled, pressure-limited mode. In SIMV mode, a set number of synchronized breaths are delivered by the ventilator (ie, 32 breaths per minute in this vignette). The tidal volume (V_T) delivered will vary based on compliance. Spontaneous breaths above the set rate are not supported, which can result in uneven V_T delivery (lower during spontaneous breaths) and may lead to increase in work of breathing during weaning. In addition, there is concern of rebreathing of dead space and subsequent inadequate alveolar ventilation (alveolar ventilation = minute ventilation - dead space).¹ However, the routine use of pressure support ventilation in combination with SIMV mitigates this problem.²

## 102. A. Bubble CPAP generates a variable distending pressure.

Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is characterized by variable distending pressure due to its unique design where the distending pressure is generated by submerging the expiratory limb in water.¹ This system can be readily translated to low-resource areas at a low cost. With bubble CPAP, the intraprong pressure may be higher than expected and is higher with higher flow rates.²,³

In a randomized controlled trial, the duration of CPAP support was decreased by 50% for preterm neonates 24 to 29 weeks' gestation in the bubble CPAP group compared with those in the ventilator-derived CPAP group. Further, there was a decrease in extubation failure in neonates ventilated for fewer than 14 days.⁴ In addition, units who use bubble CPAP as their primary mode of respiratory support in preterm neonates have reported sustained low rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.⁵

## 103. E. The leak around the endotracheal tube may vary from moment to moment depending on the positioning of the neonate's head or changes in tension on the tube.

Multiple aspects of mechanical ventilation are unique to the neonatal population, including

- Lung mechanics characterized by poor compliance, thereby predicting very short time constant, and the need for rapid respiratory rates.
- Limited muscle strength and ability to generate strong inspiratory flow or pressure, which may lead to triggering challenges and asynchrony.
- The use of uncuffed endotracheal tubes resulting in variable leak based on head position and tension of the tube. The leak is typically greater in inflation, emphasizing the need to measure inspired and expired tidal volume (V_T) in this population.
- Low V_T requirements (ie, 2–5 mL for neonates 400–1,000 g) leading to significant challenges in measuring V_T accurately. In neonates, standard measurements at the ventilator result in grossly inaccurate V_T because of loss of volume to the circuit. Because accurate V_T measurement is critical to successful volume-controlled or volume-targeted ventilation, attention to where the V_T is measured is necessary.¹

Lung development occurs in 5 overlapping stages.¹,²

- The embryonic stage (0–7 weeks), with formation of the lung bud and conducting airways (trachea, lobar, and segmental and subsegmental bronchi).
- The pseudoglandular stage (7–17 weeks), characterized by branching morphogenesis and formation of the conducting airways and terminal bronchioles. Type II pneumocyte are undifferentiated and pleuroperitoneal folds close during that stage of lung development.
- The canalicular stage (16 to 23–27 weeks), during which terminal branching occurs resulting in the formation of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and primitive alveoli. Differentiation of type II pneumocytes with emergence of lamellar bodies occurs during this stage of lung development.
- The saccular stage (26–28 to 36–38 weeks) is characterized by enlargement of the peripheral airways, saccule formation with thinning of the alveolar wall, and surfactant production in type II pneumocytes.
- The alveolar stage (approximately 36 weeks–2 years) is characterized by further thinning of the alveolar wall, secondary septation, and formation of the definitive alveoli resulting in exponential increase in the lung surface area for gas exchange.

## 107. A. Ventilated patients pose particular problems in effective administration of aerosol because large amounts of aerosol are deposited in ventilated tubing and proximal airways without reaching peripheral airways.

Inhaled corticosteroids are an attractive option for the treatment and prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) because of the theoretical advantage of high local drug delivery without the adverse effects observed with systemic administration. However, the delivery of inhaled steroid in intubated preterm neonates is complicated by large amounts of aerosol deposited in the ventilator tubing and proximal airways with very little drug delivered to the lungs. In an animal model, only 1% to 2% of the aerosolized drug was delivered to the lung using the metered-dose inhaler technique.¹ Because of this, the use of surfactant as a vehicle for inhaled corticosteroid delivery has been studied in a pilot trial with promising results.² In this pilot trial, 116 very low birth weight neonates requiring mechanical ventilation and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) 0.6 or greater shortly after birth were randomized to budesonide and beractant (Survanta) or beractant alone every 8 hours until FiO₂ less than 0.4 or extubation. Neonates who received budesonide required lower mean airway pressure and had lower Paco₂ and FiO₂ requirements during the first 3 days. In addition, the combined primary outcome of death or BPD was lower in the budesonide group.

Respiratory

Several clinical trials investigating the use of inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment and prevention of BPD have yielded conflicting results. The interpretation of these trials was further complicated by a high rate of pre- or post-study systemic corticosteroid treatment. A meta-analysis of these trials concluded that the use of inhaled corticosteroid did not decrease the combined outcome of death or BPD. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse effects.³

## 108. C. A sterile tracheal aspirate culture has a high negative predictive value for VAP.

The diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is complex in neonates because obtaining non-contaminated specimens (ie, from a bronchoscopy-guided bronchoalveolar lavage) is challenging in this population. As such, diagnostic criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include a combination of clinical factors (worsening gas exchange, changes in secretions, temperature instability, abnormal white blood cell count, apnea or increased work of breathing, abnormal lung auscultation, and bradycardia or tachycardia) as well as radiographic findings to establish the diagnosis of VAP.¹ However, these criteria are nonspecific, occurring in other common neonatal conditions, and as a result the diagnosis of VAP is often subjective.² In its most current recommendations, the CDC defines ventilator-associated events as increase in fraction of inspired oxygen 0.25 or greater or mean airway pressure 4 cm H₂O or more over baseline for at least 2 days.¹

Tracheal aspirates have overall low sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of VAP. They may, however, be helpful in identifying colonization organisms and guide antibiotic therapy in neonates diagnosed with VAP.³ Because of these limitations, investigators have studied the utility of sterile tracheal aspirate cultures in the neonatal population and have reported high negative predictive value of this technique.⁴

## 109. D. There are multiple acceptable options regarding timing of surfactant administration, as treatment does not benefit neonates who do not have RDS but delay in treatment for a patient with RDS could lead to complications.

Surfactant is an important therapeutic option in neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Some neonates with RDS can be managed successfully on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation altogether. However, some neonates will have progressive RDS and proceed to require intubation and surfactant administration.

As such, the decision to proceed with surfactant administration is complex and should weigh the following considerations carefully:

- Gestational age of the neonate. The risk of CPAP failure increases at lower gestational ages.
- Age of the neonate. In neonates with RDS requiring assisted ventilation, earlier surfactant administration, within 1 to 2 hours of birth, is preferable to late-rescue surfactant and has been shown to decrease the risk of mortality, air leaks, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.¹²
- Severity and progression of RDS. While fraction of inspired oxygen thresholds are used in the decision to administer surfactant in non-intubated neonates, there is no consensus on what parameters should be considered and wide variability in clinical practice exist. The European consensus guidelines for the management of RDS suggest a threshold of 30% for neonates younger than 26 weeks' gestation and 40% for older infants.³ While the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends earlier (within 2 hours) surfactant administration, the consensus statement does not provide specific guidelines on when to administer surfactant in spontaneously breathing neonates receiving noninvasive respiratory support.²

Answers

The use of less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) techniques for surfactant delivery is another avenue currently actively investigated. Studies indicate the use of LISA decreases the need for mechanical ventilation in neonates with RDS as well as decreases the composite outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks.⁴

## 110. D. Several studies have shown an association of frequent IH events and more severe retinopathy of prematurity.

Preclinical and clinical evidence support the concept that intermittent hypoxemia (IH) episodes have a cumulative effect on mortality and morbidity. Data from experimental models indicate that IH increases oxidative stress and inflammation and leads to increase in white matter injury as well as neurofunctional deficits.¹

In preterm infants, longer and more variable IH events as well as higher percentage of time spent with oxygen saturation below 80% have been linked to increased risk of retinopathy of prematurity.²,³ In addition, an increase in IH events is also correlated with adverse neurodevelopmental impairments at 18 months, as well as late mortality.³ In a post hoc analysis, small for gestational age infants with increased IH in the first 3 days after birth were found to have increased 90-day mortality compared with appropriate for gestational age infants.²

## 111. D. For neonates who are initially treated on continuous positive airway pressure, cohort studies would suggest that a threshold of fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.30, or 0.40, may be a reasonable approach to identify those who may gain benefit from receiving surfactant.

With the successful use of noninvasive methods of respiratory support in preterm neonates, there has been a growing interest in minimally invasive surfactant therapy techniques. Studies indicate that for preterm neonates on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a fraction of inspired oxygen between 0.30 and 0.40 may be a reasonable threshold to identify neonates at risk of CPAP failure and who would benefit from receiving surfactant.¹⁻⁴

## 112. C. One gram of hemoglobin carries about 1.34 mL of oxygen when fully saturated.

Because oxygen is very insoluble, it is transported by hemoglobin. The maximum oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is 1.34 mL of oxygen per gram of hemoglobin. When all available hemoglobin sites are saturated with oxygen, the oxygen saturation is 100%, regardless of the hemoglobin level. Together hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation are the major determinant of arterial oxygen content (Cao₂). The contribution of dissolved oxygen is minimal (0.003 mL of oxygen per millimeter of mercury) and can typically be ignored. Taking the example of the newborns described in the vignette,

- Twin A (oxygen saturation 100%, hemoglobin 20 g/dL) has a Cao₂ of 26.8 mL/dL (20 × 1.34).
- Twin B (oxygen saturation 100%, hemoglobin 8 g/dL) has a Cao₂ of 10.7 (8 × 1.34).

This emphasizes the major effect of anemia on Cao₂. Even if Twin A's oxygen saturation dropped to 90% (ie, 90% of hemoglobin-binding sites are occupied), the Cao₂ would remain much higher than that of Twin B (24.1 mL/dL). This explains why tissue hypoxia may occur in severely anemic patients despite oxygen saturation of 100%.

Lipids constitute 90% of surfactant and include phospholipids and neutral lipids. Phosphatidylcholine, particularly in its desaturated form dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, is the main phospholipid responsible for lowering surface tension. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine represents about 50% of surfactant by weight. In addition to lipids, surfactant also contains surfactant proteins that facilitate absorption and spreading of the phospholipid monolayer and are essential for the optimal dynamic behavior and function of surfactant.¹,²

## 115. A. Arrested alveolar septation

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was first described by Northway and colleagues in 1967. Classic, or "old," BPD describes neonates with chronic respiratory failure associated with characteristic radiographic sequelae from prolonged mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity, in the pre-surfactant era. In these neonates, lung injury is characterized by airway injury, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and marked inflammation, as well as areas of parenchymal lung fibrosis alternating with areas of hyperinflation.¹

The hallmark of new BPD is arrest of normal alveolar septation and microvascular development resulting in diffuse alveolar/capillary hypoplasia and marked decrease in surface area for gas exchange. In contrast to classic BPD, airway injury, inflammation, and fibrosis are usually milder.²,³

The percentage of the variance in the susceptibility for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) attributable to genetic factor alone is estimated to be 53%. This estimate is based on a twin study of 252 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. In this study, the observed concordance for BPD was significantly higher than the expected concordance in the 63 monozygotic twin pairs, yielding a 53% variance in liability for BPD attributable to genetic factors after controlling for birth weight, gestational age, sex, respiratory distress syndrome, Apgar score, duration of ventilation, and birth order.¹

Economic evaluations in health care may use similar methods in determining costs but differ in assessing the intervention's effectiveness. The most common type of economic evaluation, which may use data from randomized controlled trials, is a cost-effectiveness analysis.¹,² In these studies, effectiveness is expressed as a change in a clinical outcome, such as the change in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, mortality, or neurodevelopmental outcome. In a cost-utility analysis, which is a specific type of cost-effectiveness analysis, clinical outcomes are weighted according to individuals' preferences, or utilities, and then are converted to quality-adjusted life years or disability-adjusted life years.

15. D. Society

Economic evaluations may consider the perspectives of various stakeholders. The US Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine recommends that economic analyses are undertaken from the perspective of society.¹ This provides the most comprehensive approach and includes all costs, accounting for costs to various parties involved. In addition to direct health care costs, the societal perspective will account for costs to other parties, such as the educational system and family costs for work absenteeism.

16. E. The negative predictive value of this test will depend on the prevalence of sepsis in the tested population, with higher disease prevalence leading to decreased negative predictive value.

Diagnostic tests are characterized by the following parameters:

- Sensitivity: the proportion of subjects with the disease in whom the test gives the correct answer (true-positive result)
- Specificity: the proportion of subjects without the disease in whom the test gives the right answer (true-negative result)
- Positive predictive value: the proportion of subjects with positive tests who have the disease, as calculated by true-positive results ÷ (true-positive results + false-positive results)
- Negative predictive value: the proportion of subjects with negative tests who do not have the disease, as calculated by true-negative results ÷ (false-negative results + true-negative results)

For a given test, when there is increased prevalence of disease, the positive predictive value will increase and the negative predictive value will decrease. Sensitivity and specificity are independent of prevalence.¹

the neonatal intensive care unit, a relative interpretation of the minimal risk definition could argue that different and higher risk thresholds should apply to patients in the neonatal intensive care unit than to healthy neonates.² An absolute interpretation of “ordinarily encountered harms” would hold every neonate to the same standard that is based on the experiences of a healthy neonate.

## 18. A. Interviewer bias

Interviewer bias describes the circumstance in which an interviewer as part of a research study has different methods in questioning subjects. For example, an interviewer may probe more deeply regarding smoking history if the mother is from a lower socioeconomic background. This would lead to increased accounting of smoking habits in women with a lower socioeconomic status than it would with women with a higher socioeconomic status.¹

## 19. A. An appropriate statement of the null hypothesis for this research question would be, “There is no difference in fine motor development scores in children who were preterm neonates who receive supplement Z compared with results in those who do not receive supplement Z.”

The basis of much of biomedical research relies on hypothesis testing. A simple hypothesis has 1 predictor and 1 outcome variable. The null hypothesis refers to restating the research hypothesis so that it proposes no difference between groups being compared in order to allow for statistical testing.¹ The statement in this answer is an example of a null hypothesis.

## 20. B. Computerized physician order entry

Preventable adverse drug events may be mitigated by adoption of a variety of measures. Some low-tech interventions include education, avoidance of certain abbreviations, handoff verifications, standardized concentrations of infusions, and intuitive storage solutions. Computerized physician order entry is a relatively expensive measure that can also facilitate reduction of drug errors.¹

## 21. B. Dose-response relationship: mothers who used more marijuana had neonates with even lower birth weight than did mothers who used smaller amounts of marijuana

In a classic essay entitled, “The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation,” the British epidemiologist Sir Austin Bradford Hill described the criteria for causation (Hill’s criteria for causation).¹ While there are slight modifications in various versions that cite Hill’s criteria, the following summarizes the core principles:

- Temporal relationship: exposure occurs before the occurrence of disease (outcome)
- Strength of the association: measured by relative risk or odds ratio
- Specificity of the association: a specific exposure is associated with only 1 disease
- Dose-response relationship: increasing dose of exposure leads to increasing risk of disease
- Biological plausibility: the relationship is in agreement with the body of biological knowledge
- Replication of findings: replication in different populations and different studies
- Cessation of exposure: the risk of disease decreases with decreasing or removing the exposure
- Consistency with other knowledge: association is found in different subgroups, such as in both men and women
- Consideration of alternate explanations: if alternate explanations are excluded, likelihood of causation increases

## 22. C. Study design

Studies considered in a given systematic review often have differences. This variability among studies in a systematic review is termed heterogeneity. Clinical heterogeneity refers to variability in the participants, interventions, and outcomes considered. Methodological heterogeneity refers to variability in the study design. Clinical or methodological heterogeneity may contribute to measurable statistical heterogeneity. Methods have been developed for quantifying inconsistency across studies that move the focus away from testing whether heterogeneity is present (which is almost inevitable) to assessing the effect of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis. The $I^2$ statistic is used to evaluate whether substantial heterogeneity is present in a meta-analysis and may influence its interpretation.¹

## 23. D. Presymptomatic state: this screening is a form of secondary prevention, allowing for detection of the condition at an earlier point in the natural history of the disease

The rationale for implementing a screening test depends on several factors:

- Prevalence: The prevalence of the detectable preclinical phase of the disease should be reasonably high among the population screened.
- Accuracy: The test should have a high ability to detect true disease and to distinguish between who has a disease and who does not. A screening test ideally should be highly sensitive and reasonably specific to detect disease but also not lead to too many false-positive results.
- Risk-benefit ratio: The costs, benefits, and risks should be considered for both those affected by the disease and those who may have positive results even though they do not have the disease.
- Presymptomatic state: The test should be available to detect the condition before the onset of symptoms or at least early in the disease course. Once a patient has symptoms, the natural history of a disease may continue to progress to a critical point beyond which an appropriate treatment is less effective or more difficult to administer.

The rationale for pulse oximetry for congenital heart disease screening has been established based on these factors.¹²

## 24. E. Stratification

Various strategies in study design can be implemented to manage the potential for confounding variables. Stratification segregates individuals into subgroups by analyzing the study question in more than 1 group. In this example, the potential confounding factor of human milk receipt will be removed by stratifying the study group into those who did and those who did not receive human milk.¹

## 25. C. The risk-benefit profile is at least as favorable as the existing alternatives to research participation.

According to the Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, part 46, a study that is not considered minimal risk should hold out potential direct benefit. To meet this requirement, the risk of the research protocol must be justified by the anticipated benefits. Furthermore, the risk-benefit profile must be at least as favorable as the existing alternatives to research participation.¹

Answers

Sensitivity = true positive / (true positive + false negative) = 62 / (62 + 26) = 70%
Specificity = true negative / (false positive + true negative) = 74 / (38 + 74) = 66%
Positive predictive value = true positive / (true positive + false positive) = 62 / (62 + 38) = 62%
Negative predictive value = true negative / (true negative + false negative) = 74 / (74 + 26) = 74%
Likelihood ratio for positive result = sensitivity / (1 - specificity) = 0.7 / (1 - 0.66) = 2.06
Likelihood ratio for negative result = specificity / (1 - sensitivity) = 0.66 / (1 - 0.7) = 2.2

The number needed to treat is the reciprocal of absolute risk reduction. It is calculated for this example as follows:

## 28. D. Physician

A multidisciplinary team is essential to providing compassionate and comprehensive care to a family facing challenging circumstances, such as in extremely preterm birth. In that setting, physicians should exercise responsive leadership in making ethically and legally sound decisions and also in facilitating avenues for discussion and opportunities for any disagreement or discomfort to be voiced. In the current standard of joint decision-making in neonatal intensive care unit care, parents are accorded primary, but not absolute, decision-making authority; physicians bear the ultimate responsibility for care.

## 29. A. Application and dissemination of evidence-based treatments to promote individual patient and public health outcomes

One categorization of translational research in medicine is as follows:

- T1: translating biomedical science to clinical efficacy knowledge
- T2: translating clinical efficacy knowledge to clinical effectiveness knowledge
- T3: translating clinical effectiveness knowledge to improved health care quality and value and public health

This last step of T3 translational research aims to study how evidence-based treatments can be best disseminated and applied in a broad spectrum of clinical settings to improve individual patient outcomes and public health.

## 30. D. Justice: the burdens and benefits of research should be equitably distributed such that potential subjects are not targeted disproportionately to bear the brunt of the risk

The ethical principles in The Belmont Report include the following:

- Respect for persons: individuals should be treated as autonomous agents; persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection
- Beneficence: do no harm; maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harm; consider the risks and benefits to society or particular populations, as well as to the individual subject
- Justice: distribute the burdens and benefits of research equitably such that potential subjects (or populations) are not targeted disproportionately to bear the brunt of the risk or excluded when they benefit from participation

## 33. B. Avoid the term withdrawal of care

A key principle in effective communication is to speak directly to the family and use concise, lay language. A message may need to be repeated several times. Euphemisms for disease or death should not be used. Open statements are preferable. The words *withdrawal of treatment* or *withdrawal of care* should be avoided, and the parents should be ensured that their neonate will continue to receive care, such as for symptoms of discomfort or pain. Munson and colleagues¹ also have other tips for optimal communication, such as referring to the child by name; meeting in a quiet, private place; and showing empathy.

## 35. E. Greater than 0.9

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are created by plotting the sensitivity at a specific threshold on the y-axis, with 1 – specificity of the same test at the same threshold plotted on the x-axis.¹ The diagnostic performance of the test is plotted at multiple thresholds to create a curve. The area under the curve (AUC) is a summary statistic that describes the accuracy of the test. When the optimal cutoff for a quantitative test moves closer to (0,1), the AUC increases. A test that is only as good as chance has an AUC of 0.5, whereas a perfect test would have an AUC of 1.0.
