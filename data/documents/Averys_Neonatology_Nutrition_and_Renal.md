Nutrition and Growth: The Fetus

WILLIAM W. HAY JR and KENDRA HENDRICKSON

## CHANGES IN BODY COMPOSITION

### Growth of Fetal Size

- Fetal weight increases exponentially in the middle of gestation, then slows during the latter third of gestation
- Normal human fetuses grow: average rate of ~17 g/kg/day from 28–40 weeks, with symmetrical growth of head and length

### Developmental Change of Fetal Body Composition

- Nonfat dry weight and nitrogen content (predictors of protein content and lean body mass) show a linear relationship with fetal weight and an exponential relationship with gestational age (GA)
- 80% of the nitrogen content of the fetus is in protein
- With advancing gestation, fetal protein synthesis rate declines
- Skeletal muscle has lower protein synthetic rate in late gestation than in earlier gestation
- Fat production in the fetus begins at start of the third trimester
- Rate of fetal fat accretion is linear between 36–40 weeks’ gestation
- By end of gestation: fat accretion ranges from 1.6–3.4 grams/kg/day
- By term: fat content of the human fetus is 12%–18% of body weight
- &lt;10% in severely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) fetuses
- &gt;20% in macrosomic infants of diabetic mothers
- Rate of fetal fatty acid oxidation is low due to:
- Low plasma fatty acids concentration
- The carnitine palmitoyl transferase enzyme system is not sufficiently developed to deliver long-chain fatty acids to the respiration pathway inside the mitochondria
- Fetal water content increases directly with body weight (as fraction of body weight, decreases with advancing gestation)
- Extracellular water decreases are greater than intracellular water as gestation advances due to:
- Increased cell number and increase cell size
- Many tissues in the fetus (brain, liver, lung, heart, and skeletal muscle) produce glycogen over the second half of gestation
- Liver glycogen content: most important store of carbohydrate (CHO) for systemic glucose needs immediately after birth
- Skeletal muscle glycogen content increases during late gestation (source of glucose for glycolysis within the myocytes)

- Lung glycogen content decreases in late gestation with
- Loss of glycogen-containing alveolar epithelial cells
- Development of type II pneumocytes
- Onset of surfactant production
- Cardiac glycogen essential for postnatal cardiac energy metabolism and function
- Fetal liver glycogen concentration is ~80–120 mg/gm at term, twice adult concentration
- Macrosomic fetuses of diabetic mothers: high body and organ contents of glycogen
- IUGR fetuses have normal to increased hepatic glycogen content

## NUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS

### Glucose

- Principal substrate in the fetus for: maintenance of energy production and expenditure, energy storage in, energy requirements of protein synthesis and growth
- Glucose utilization rates (GUR) in the human fetus
- Higher at mid-gestation: 7–9 mg/kg/min at 24–28 weeks’ gestation when fetal brain size, fetal growth, and protein synthetic rates are twice than at term
- GUR declines to 3–5 mg/kg/min at term (as bone, fat, and muscle increase as fractions of body weight)

### Amino Acids (AAs)

- Supplied to the fetus at 3.5–4 g/kg/day at 24–28 weeks’ gestation (decreases to 2.5 g/kg/day at term)

### Fatty Acids (FAs)

- FA uptake rates by the fetus have not been measured
- FAs are used for structural components of membranes and for growth of adipose tissue in later gestation
- Fatty acid oxidation rates are low in the fetus (due to limited supply and lack of enzymes necessary for mitochondrial fatty acid uptake)

## FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE INTRAUTERINE GROWTH

### Hormonal Factors

- Fetal insulin production begins at the start of the second trimester and increases in response to glucose and AAs as gestation progresses.
- Insulin and AAs promote the production of IGF-1 (insulin growth factor) (enhances growth).
- The predominant growth-regulating effect of insulin in the fetus is its capacity to enhance glucose utilization.

# Maternal, Placental, and Fetal Factors

- Fetal weight in late gestation correlates positively with placental weight.
- Oxygen transport to the fetus by the placenta: facilitated by increases in uteroplacental blood flow.
- Transport of glucose and AAs determined by trophoblast membrane exchange area, transporter concentrations, and activity in the trophoblast membranes.
- AAs are actively concentrated in the trophoblast intracellular matrix by Na+/K+-adenosine triphosphate-(ATP) ase-F and H+-dependent transporter proteins at the maternal-facing microvillus membrane of the trophoblast and then transported into the fetal plasma to concentrations higher than maternal levels.
- Net total fetal AAs uptake is 30%–40% of the combined carbon requirements for oxidative metabolism and provides 100% of the fetal nitrogen requirements.
- AAs are directly transported from maternal to fetal plasma by the placenta or may be metabolized into other AAs, then interact with metabolic pathways in the fetus that

- Recycle certain AAs to the placenta
- Promote vascular development (arginine producing nitric oxide)
- Promote oxidation (ketoisocaproic acid from leucine)
- Promote protein synthesis (including synthesis of non-essential AAs)

- Skeletal muscle in later gestation is a major consumer of both essential and nonessential AAs from the circulation.
- Rate of glucose transfer from maternal to fetal plasma directly related to the maternal glucose concentration.
- Placental glucose transport increases progressively over gestation.

- Reflecting growth of the surface area of the trophoblast
- Reflecting increased numbers of glucose transporters

- The concentration of glucose in the fetal plasma declines relative to maternal plasma glucose in the second half of gestation.
- Three principal mechanisms responsible for the increase in glucose clearance:

- The size, cellularity, and glucose metabolic rate of the brain increase relative to other fetal tissues and organs.
- Progressive development of fetal insulin secretion by the expanding mass of pancreatic islets and beta cells.
- Increased growth of insulin-sensitive tissues (skeletal muscle, heart, adipose tissue).

- Evidence for a relatively high rate of fetal oxidation of AAs comes from three observations:

- AAs are taken up by the fetus in excess of their rate of deposition in fetal protein.
- Fetal urea production rates are high.
- Fetal infusions of carbon-labeled AAs in animal models demonstrate fetal production and excretion of labeled carbon dioxide.

- Free FAs are transported by concentration dependent transporters.

- Transport is increased when maternal concentrations are high.

# Newborn Infants

## CHANGES IN BODY COMPOSITION

- Significant portion of preterm infants have IUGR, tend to be SGA
- First few postnatal days: all newborn infants lose extracellular fluid and thus body weight
- The more preterm the infant, the slower the growth of the body in all compartments
- Majority of very preterm infants remain relatively growth restricted by term gestation

- The main cause is insufficient nutrition (primarily of protein).
- Other causes include: intermittent hypoxia, stress with increased catabolic hormone secretion, and sepsis.

- By term: preterm infants are shorter and lighter than term infants (with relatively more fat than lean mass)

## ENERGY REQUIREMENTS

- Energy needs for preterm infants to achieve normal growth rates (Table 23.1).

- Total energy intake must be sufficient to support basal metabolism (~50 kcal/kg/day)
- Growth requires additional energy (25–35 kcal/kg/day)
- Energy lost in stools increases with enteral feeding (5–10 kcal/kg/day)
- Physical activity accounts for 1%–2% of total energy expenditure in preterm infants
- Total energy needs are reduced by 5–10 kcal/kg/day for infants in incubators/radiant warmers

- There is no evidence that energy intake above normal levels enhances neurologic development or achieves appropriate growth and body composition.
- Higher energy intakes in preterm infants result in greater fat accumulation compared to normally growing fetuses of the same GA.

## PROTEIN INTAKE IN NEWBORNS

### Essential and Nonessential Amino Acids

- Essential AAs: cannot be synthesized in body cells, must be provided from exogenous sources for normal maintenance and growth, indispensable for growth

[tbl-9.html](tbl-9.html)

---

<!-- Page 174 -->

Essential AAs include leucine, isoleucine, valine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, phenylalanine, and histidineNonessential AAs can be synthesized in body cellsAt critical stages of development (in the fetus or preterm infant of similar GA) some may not be synthesized sufficiently (conditionally essential AAs)

### Protein Requirements of Newborns

Protein requirement of the healthy term infant in the first month of life is 2.0 g/kg/dayProtein requirement of preterm infants is higher (2.5--4.5 g/kg/day) depending on GAProtein accretion is linearly related to protein intake at any energy intake:~2.0 g/kg/day at term2.5--3.0 g/kg/day at ~30--36 weeks3.5--4.0 g/kg/day at ~24--30 weeksRates of protein synthesis and the requirements for amino acid and protein supply are the same in preterm infants as in normally growing fetuses of the same GACritical amount of amino acid for preventing growth faltering in very preterm infants (<30--32 weeks) is ~1.5 g/kg/dayProtein accretion increases directly with protein intake and sufficient energy for protein synthesis to maximal rates for GAAAs >3.5--4.0 g/kg/day parenterally or 4.0--4.5 g/kg/day enterally in very preterm infants offer no advantageExcess protein intake can produce higher blood urea and ammonia concentrations (seldom toxic levels)Increased ammonia and urea are appropriate as protein intake is increased (suggests normally functioning amino acid oxidation and urea synthesis)Venous plasma concentrations of urea (>60 mg/dL) and ammonia (>100 μmol/L) are usually confounded by renal and liver failureProtein intake > carbohydrate (CHO) diets in preterm infants produces leaner infants by termHigher protein intake with adequate CHO intake results in lower weight gain, but higher percentage of lean body mass

### Protein Metabolism in Newborn Infants

Protein digestion begins in the stomach and duodenum with acid hydrolysisBasal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion doubles from the first to fourth week after birth in preterm infantsProteases (enterokinase) produced in the upper small intestine in response to foodActivation of trypsinogen is essentialKey enzyme in initiating the cascade of protein digestion by proteasesTrypsinogen levels: 6% (25--30 weeks' gestation) and 29% at term of older childrenDespite low GI proteases in preterm infants: no evidence of insufficient protein digestionHydrolyzed protein formulas: increase amino acid absorptionReduce time to full enteral feedsDo not promote greater protein balance for the same protein intakeHave lower total amino acid contents than nonhydrolyzed protein formulas

## FAT INTAKE IN NEWBORNS

### Features of Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency

Clinical cases of essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency are relatively rareEFA deficiency (severe and prolonged) can lead to a clinical syndrome consisting of:Dermatitis (perianal region)ThrombocytopeniaInfectionFailure to thriveAn increased triene/tetraene ratioPrevention of EFA deficiency: enteral feeding of milk as soon as possible after birthTerm and preterm formulas have added DHA and ARAThe requirement for EFA met by 0.5--1.0 g/kg/day intake in the form of IV lipid, or as 2g/kg/d for Smof lipid emulsions (from soybean oil) as 20% (0.2 g/mL) solutionPreterm infants may benefit from PUFAs supplementation (important for growth and brain and visual development)

### Essential and Nonessential Fatty Acids

Preterm infants have insufficient capacity for de novo synthesis of LC-PUFAs (need from diet)Linoleic acid (18:2, ω-6) and α-linolenic acid (18:3, ω-3) are the only fatty acids known to be essential for complete nutrition

### Fat Requirements of Preterm and Full-Term Infants

Human neonates have relatively high white fat content: 12%--18% of body weight at termThe term infant also has stores of brown fat (necessary for neonatal thermogenesis)In utero fat deposition occurs predominantly during the last 12 to 14 weeks of gestationDietary fats important to sustain growth, provide EFA, and promote the absorption of fat-soluble vitaminsFat intakes of 2--3 g/kg/day IV in the first few days of life provide sufficient LC-PUFAs and calories for basal metabolism and prevention of EFA deficiencyRecommended dietary fat intakes in infants consist of 40%--55% of total calories (4.4--6.0 g/100 kcal) as provided by normal breast feeding

### Fat Metabolism in Newborn Infants

Newborn infants absorb fat less efficiently than older childrenPreterm infants demonstrate even greater deficiencies in fat digestion and metabolismPreterm infants malabsorb 10%--30% of dietary fat due to a small bile acid pool and relative lack of pancreatic lipaseBile acids are lower in preterm infantsBile stimulated lipase activity is higher in milk of mothers delivering preterm than in those delivering at termBile acids are essential to emulsify large fat globules of long-chain fatty acids and to facilitate lipid hydrolysisAdditional fat digestion: by lingual and gastric lipases (lipase in human milk)

---

<!-- Page 175 -->

Pancreatic lipases are less available for fat digestion and absorptionPreterm formulas and human milk fortifiers have high percentages of fat from medium-chain triglycerides (do not need bile acid emulsification)

### Carbohydrate intake in newborns

### Carbohydrate Metabolism in Newborn Infants

Newborns exhaust the supply of stored glucose from the liver within 12 hours of birth if milk/formula or IV glucose is not providedThe normal glucose utilization rate in the term newborn is 4--6 mg/kg/min50% of an infant's energy needs are normally provided by CHO metabolismGlucose is the primary energy source for brain metabolismPreterm infant: glucose is largely derived from exogenous CHO sources once glycogenolysis has exhausted stored hepatic glucoseGluconeogenesis develops soon after birth and is not easily suppressed by increases in plasma glucose or insulin concentrationsMaintenance of normal plasma glucose concentrations is fundamentalVital organs (brain and heart) take up glucose according to plasma glucose concentrations and not IV infusion rates or rates of hepatic glucose productionWhen plasma glucose concentrations decline: newborn brain may use ketone bodies as additional energy sourcesLimited in very preterm and SGA infants with IUGRMechanisms for enteral CHO digestion and absorption mature in a defined sequence in the human fetusSucrase, maltase, and isomaltase are fully active by 24--28 weeks' gestationLactase is not fully active at birth until termPancreatic amylase activity remains low until after term birthSalivary amylase activity is present even in very preterm infantsOther CHO (mannose, inositol), oligosaccharides (prebiotics) have important roles in nutrition and organ development for the preterm infantMannose is an essential CHO for protein glycosylation and normal neural developmentInositol is present in high concentrations in human milk and can be synthesized by newborn infants of ≥33 weeks' gestationPredominant CHO in human milk is lactose (glucose + galactose)Galactose provides 50% of the calories derived from lactoseMajor metabolic role in energy storageNewborn liver readily incorporates galactose from the portal circulation into hepatic glycogenProvision of 40%--50% of total caloric intake as CHO (10--12 g/kg/day) prevents accumulation of ketone bodies and hypoglycemia in the newbornThis amount of CHO is supplied as lactose in human milk or formulasDigestion of complex CHO occurs in the lumen of the intestine, and nutrient absorption occurs at the enterocyte interface (microvillus membrane)CHO absorption limited initially in neonates by a relative deficiency of lactase (splits lactose into glucose and galactose)Lactase activity in infant <34 weeks' gestation is 30% of normal term infantLactase functional activity increases with feeding in preterm infants and approaches term levels by 10 days after birth20% of dietary lactose reach the colon in neonates where it lowers pHPromotes colonic growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus Preterm formulas have reduced lactose content (40%--50% of the total CHO)Milk fortifiers provide little to no lactoseIf signs of lactose intolerance (frequent loose stools, abdominal distention, or positive stool reducing substances), a lactose-free infant formula may be consideredHelpful for calculations: energy from fat: 9 kcal/g; protein: 4 kcal/g; carbohydrate: 4 kcal/g

## Large and Small for Gestational Age Infants

### Postnatal Growth Patterns of SGA Infants

Small for gestational age (SGA) infants; not growth restricted in utero and with small mothers and fathers tend to grow along the lower growth percentiles at which they were bornTend to be shorter later in lifeHead circumference growth increases in proportion to length and weight SGA infants with recent IUGRDue to nutritional deficiency from placental insufficiencyTend to catch up in growth Chronically IUGR fetuses develop decreased capacity for amino acid synthesis into protein and for cell growthLeads to decreased muscle mass and glucose intolerance (reduced glucose uptake and utilization capacity) Chronically SGA/IUGR infants have downregulated capacity for protein synthesis and net protein accretion and often have evidence of increased protein breakdownPersistent slower growth is commonLater life shorter stature, smaller brains, and reduced neurocognitive development No consensus about the optimal amount of protein to feed SGA/IUGR infantsProvide weight-appropriate amounts of milk and limiting amino acid in TPN to 3.0--3.5 g/kg/dayEvidence for benefit or risk from such restricted nutrition for these IUGR infants is lacking

### Fetal Origins of Adult Onset Disorders

Fetal nutrition deprivation produces adaptive mechanisms to help ensure survival to birthProgramming: these adaptive mechanisms that may persist after birth into adulthood include:

---

<!-- Page 176 -->

SECTION 6
•
Nutrition

- Upregulation of glucose and insulin sensitivity from increased glucose transporters and insulin receptors
- Diminished insulin secretion
- Reduced muscle mass and lean body growth (includes bone and brain)
- Such programming allows later life insults ("second hits") of excess energy and leads to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders
- Both IUGR and macrosomic infants tend to develop this common later life phenotype
- The more preterm the infant at birth, the higher the prevalence of hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and fatty liver index in an adult who was born preterm vs. an adult born at term
- Rapid postnatal growth rate: weight gain &gt; growth rates of length and head circumference, sign of excess energy intake and production of fat (risk of later obesity)

## IUGR and SGA Infants

- IUGR refers to a slower than normal rate of fetal growth
- Undernutrition from placental insufficiency is the leading cause of IUGR in developed countries
- Maternal undernutrition the leading cause in less developed countries

## Classification of Fetal Growth

- SGA infants have a birth weight &lt;10th percentile for gestational age
- Appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants have a birth weight between the 10th and 90th percentiles for gestational age
- Large for gestational age (LGA) infants have a birth weight &gt;90th percentile for gestational age
- IUGR infants have a slower than normal rate of fetal growth at any gestational age
- Macrosomic infants weigh &gt;4500 g at term birth
- Normal birth weight infants weigh &gt;2500 g at term birth
- Low birth weight (LBW) infants weigh &lt;2500 g at any gestational age
- Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants weigh &lt;1500 g at any gestational age
- Extremely-low-birth-weight (ELBW) infants weigh &lt;1000 g at any gestational age
- IUGR infants characteristically develop both hyper- (usually early after birth) and hypoglycemia (usually later)
- Initial hyperglycemia in IUGR neonates due to: decreased pancreatic insulin secretion reduced fetal pancreatic beta cell proliferation (response to reduced glucose, amino acid, growth factor stimulation, and hypoxia)
- IUGR fetuses tend to produce glucose from their livers (which normal fetuses do not) by uniquely developed hepatic insulin resistance in response to glucocorticoids and hypoxia
- After birth (24–72 hours) hyperglycemia: due to continued stress and hypoxia with high rates of IV glucose infusion
- Once stabilized, IUGR newborn infants often develop hypoglycemia, can continue for days to weeks
- Causes of hypoglycemia in IUGR infant
- IUGR fetuses respond to chronically reduced glucose supply and concentrations by upregulating glucose transporters and the maintenance of glucose utilization by all organs (sustaining normal cellular metabolism)
- As oxygenation improves, catecholamines diminish, reducing their suppression of insulin secretion
- Frequent feedings day and night are the best approach to treating mild to moderate hypoglycemia
- Rarely, diazoxide can be used to suppress insulin secretion; this agent has serious side effects, including pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension

## Large for Gestational Age (LGA) Infants

- LGA infants can be normal (e.g., from large mothers and fathers), or from excess energy intake and fat production (macrosomia), the latter due to infants of gestational diabetics and infants whose mothers were obese or with metabolic syndrome
- Exposure to high glucose concentrations produces a common fetal and neonatal phenotype of excess adiposity and high insulin secretion rates, especially in response to sudden hyperglycemia, leading to rebound hypoglycemia (asymptomatic and symptomatic)
- Optimal management expectant: enteral feeding started as soon as possible after birth to diminish IV glucose stimulation of insulin secretion
- Smaller and more frequent feedings, and often continuous enteral feeding via OG/NG tubes, can prevent hyperinsulinism
- Term IDMs: not acutely hypoglycemic have total GUR of only 3–4 mg/kg/min, considerably below the infusion rates many of these infants receive
- Contributing to this lower body weight specific utilization rate is the larger fat mass in these infants
- Adjusting IV glucose infusion rates to a body weight more consistent with the head circumference often helps avoid advancing to higher glucose infusion rates with risk of stimulating excess insulin secretion (the brain is where most of the glucose is used in the body)

Minerals, Vitamins, and Trace Minerals

WILLIAM W. HAY JR and KENDRA HENDRICKSON

# Minerals (Table 24.1)

## NEONATAL MINERAL REQUIREMENTS AT VARIOUS GESTATIONAL AGES

- Sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), and potassium (K) intakes restricted right after birth due to:
- Delayed urinary flow rates: exacerbated by RDS
- Avoid volume overload
- Once urinary flow rates established: requirements of Na, K, and Cl are between 2 and 4 mmol/kg/day (higher for preterm infants)
- After this period: urinary excretion of electrolytes depends on intake
- Cl intake restricted when dilutional acidosis occurs
- Cl added: when respiratory failure leads to CO₂ retention, with bicarbonate retention and metabolic alkalosis
- Typical urinary concentrations for Na are 20–40 mmol/L and K 10–30 mmol/L
- In infants receiving diuretic therapy: urinary Na concentrations can reach up to 70 mmol/L
- Insufficient Na intake impairs longitudinal growth and lean mass gain

## REQUIREMENTS OF CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS AT VARIOUS GESTATIONAL AGES

- Enteral absorption rates for both calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) are limited in preterm infants
- Enhanced with calcium and phosphorus enriched preterm formulas
- Adequate enteral intake for term infants in the first 6 months of life:
- Calcium: 70 mg/kg/day
- Phosphorus: ~100 mg/day
- Requirements for preterm infants are much higher due to more active bone formation and remodeling:
- Calcium: 150–220 mg/kg/day
- Phosphorus: 60–140 mg/kg/day
- Ideal Ca:P ratio 1.8:1 to 2:1 mg, weight basis
- Fortification of human milk: ensure adequate intakes of calcium and phosphorus to preterm infants fed human milk (natural mother’s milk and donor milk)
- Recommended IV intakes of calcium and phosphorus lower than enteral requirements:
- Calcium: 65–100 mg/kg/day
- Phosphorus: 50–80 mg/kg/day
- Ideal Ca:P ratio of 1.3:1 to 1.7:1 mg, weight basis

- Risk factors in preterm infants for calcium and phosphorus deficiency (subsequent rickets) are:
- Gestational age &lt;27 weeks or birth weight &lt;1000 grams
- Long-term parenteral nutrition (&gt;4–5 weeks)
- Severe BPD requiring diuretics
- Fluid restriction
- Long-term steroid treatment
- History of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
- Intolerance to enteral formula or human milk

# Vitamins (Table 24.1)

## REQUIREMENTS FOR VITAMINS IN NEWBORN INFANTS

- Vitamins: organic substances, present in trace amounts in natural food and essential to normal metabolism
- Biologic roles of many vitamins are not completely understood in preterm infants
- Vitamins generally are given on a weight specific basis (not gestational age (GA))
- Because vitamins have a central role in many metabolic processes, signs of vitamin deficiency are nonspecific: lethargy, irritability, and poor growth
- Routine supplementation of vitamins above the recommended doses not advised
- Table 24.1 shows recommended vitamin intake for enterally fed preterm infants

## MANIFESTATIONS OF WATER-SOLUBLE VITAMIN DEFICIENCES

- Water-soluble vitamin deficiencies are uncommon in preterm and term infants
- Vitamin B₁ (thiamine): important in the pentose phosphate pathway and oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto acids
- Thiamine deficiency (Beriberi)
- Clinical syndrome with neurologic and cardiac symptoms
- Not seen in newborn infants (adequate B₁ in breast milk/formula)
- Vitamin B₂ (riboflavin): catalyzes oxidation-reduction reactions
- Riboflavin deficiency: dermatitis, cheilosis, and glossitis
- Vitamin B₃ (niacin): mediates oxidation-reduction reactions

Nutrition

Table 24.1 Recommended Vitamin and Trace Mineral Intakes for Enterally Fed Preterm and Term Infants

[tbl-10.html](tbl-10.html)

aRE: retinol equivalents
bTE: tocopherol equivalents

- Niacin deficiency (pellagra):
- Classical "four D" conditions of dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and death

Vitamin B₄ (biotin) deficiency symptoms include:
- Glossitis, dermatitis, loss of appetite, nausea

Vitamin B₅ (pantothenic acid): is a component of coenzyme A (CoA)
- Transferring acyl groups (succinyl CoA, fatty acyl CoA, and acetyl CoA)
- A component of fatty acid synthase
- Deficiency not seen in preterm infants

Vitamin B₆ (pyridoxine): precursor to pyridoxal phosphate that functions as a coenzyme for enzymes that catalyze reactions involving amino acid metabolism
- Deficiency conditions are not seen in preterm infants

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid): deficiency classically causes scurvy
- Characterized by sore, spongy gums, loose teeth, fragile blood vessels, swollen joints, and anemia (not seen in preterm infants)
- Vitamin C promotes GI iron absorption and serves as an antioxidant

Vitamin B₁₂ (cyanocobalamin) is important for hematopoiesis
- Vitamin B₁₂ deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and associated neurologic dysfunction
- Deficiency states, although rare, can be seen in
- Breastfed infants whose mothers follow a strict vegan or vegetarian diet that is deficient in vitamin B₁₂
- Infants with short bowel syndrome (SBS) where the terminal ileum is removed

- Folate (vitamin B₉): functions to receive one-carbon fragments from donors (serine, glycine, histidine) and transfer them to intermediates in the synthesis of amino acids (AAs)
- Most common vitamin deficiency in the United States (particularly in pregnant women)

# MANIFESTATION OF FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMIN DEFICIENCIES

- Infants with fat malabsorption due to cholestatic liver disease or SBS are at risk for developing fat-soluble vitamin deficiency
- Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation may be necessary in these patients

Vitamin A is essential for growth and differentiation of epithelial tissues (includes the lung)
- Preterm infants have low stores of vitamin A at birth
- Preterm infants with lung disease have lower plasma vitamin A levels than those without lung disease
- Vitamin A deficiency may contribute to the development of BPD
- Vitamin A supplementation has not become standard practice (due to need for repeated IM injections)

Vitamin D is essential for bone health
- Infants who require assisted ventilation, have no exposure to UV light in the hospital, and limited exposure after discharge have minimal cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D
- Recommended enteral intake of vitamin D is 200–400 IU per day
- This dose maintains adequate (&gt;50 nmol/L) serum concentrations of vitamin D and helps to prevent vitamin D-deficiency associated rickets
- Higher doses (800–1000 IU per day) have been recommended for infants with extreme prematurity, SBS, cholestasis, long-term exposure to diuretics and/or steroids

Vitamin E: major natural antioxidant, protecting lipid-containing RBC cell membranes against oxidative injury, reducing hemolysis, and may prevent neonatal oxygen toxicity (retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH))
- Recommended enteral vitamin E intake is 3.3–16.4 IU/kg/day
- The dietary ratio of vitamin E to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) should be ≥0.6 mg of D-α-tocopherol (0.9 IU) per gram of PUFA
- Recommended IV vitamin E is 2.8 IU/kg/day as α-tocopheryl acetate

Vitamin K prevents hemorrhagic disease of the newborn in the first weeks of life
- A single dose of intramuscular vitamin K (1.0 mg) is sufficient
- Subsequent vitamin K supplementation helps prevent deficiency in critically ill infants who receive broad-spectrum antibiotics (reduces vitamin K synthesis by gut bacteria) and may have other abnormalities of hemostasis or hepatic function

Potential Adverse Effects of Pharmacologic Use of Fat-Soluble Vitamins

Vitamin A: acute toxicity can lead to liver damage and increased intracranial pressure (bulging fontanelle, vomiting, papilledema)Vitamin D: excessive dosing results in (infant discharged on high dose vitamin D)Hypercalcemia, constipation, muscle weakness, and vomitingSevere cases: damage the bones and kidneys Vitamin E: excessive dosing is associated with increased incidence of hemolytic anemia, ROP, BPD, and ICHIncreases risk of sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and retinal hemorrhage in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants Vitamin K: excessive dosing causes hemolytic anemia (results in hyperbilirubinemia)Blocks the effects of oral anticoagulants

### Trace Minerals

The content of trace minerals in human milk is the gold standard for requirements in term infantsRequirements for the preterm infant estimated from in utero accretion ratesPreterm infants are relatively lacking in some important minerals (e.g. iron, zinc)Accumulation occurs mostly in the third trimester Trace mineral supplementation of human milk or use of an enriched preterm formula usually is necessary to achieve the recommended trace element requirementsTrace mineral deficiencies: most common in those infants with excessive GI losses from ostomy/fistula output or diarrhea

### IRON

Iron intake: 2--4 mg/kg/day for both term and preterm enterally fedPreterm infant with anemia of prematurity and on erythropoietin: 6 mg/kg/day Risks of iron overload and toxicity (e.g. possible increased risk of ROP) increase with red cell transfusionsIron supplementation often is delayed for 2 weeks after a transfusion Potential risks of IV iron in preterm infants include neonatal sepsis, iron overload, and anaphylaxisFormula-fed infants should receive only iron-fortified formula

### OTHER TRACE MINERALS

Zinc deficiencyAcrodermatitis enteropathica: inborn error of zinc (Zn) metabolismInherited as an autosomal recessive disorderCharacterized by growth impairment, periorofacial and acral dermatitis with perianal inflammation and excoriationAcquired Zn deficiency: from prolonged maternal milk ingestion in mothers with low Zn levelsPreterm formulas and human milk fortifiers meet Zn requirementsSmall for gestational age (SGA)/intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) infants and infants with intestinal resection greater risk for Zn deficiencyHuman milk Zn content declines over the early months of lactation Copper: copper (Cu) deficiency is rare, occurs when Cu is withheld from parenteral nutrition (PN) due to associated PN liver diseaseCurrent recommendations: remove Cu only if evidence of toxicity is presentDeficiency signs in neonates: hypopigmentation of skin and hair, bone abnormalities, microcytic hypochromic anemia unresponsive to iron therapy, neutropenia, and leukopenia.Cu dosage may be increased to 10--15 micrograms/kg/day in infants experiencing abnormally high biliary or enterostomy drainageHigh doses of enteral Zn and iron intake can contribute to Cu deficiencySelenium: deficiency includes increased risk of sepsis, cardiac and skeletal muscle myopathies, abnormalities in hair and nails, microcytic anemia, and increased erythrocyte fragilitySelenium (Se) deficiency more likely in infants with SBSManganese: a cofactor in numerous enzyme systemsDeficiency: rare, limited to mucopolysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide formationChromium: deficiency includes neuropathy and hyperglycemia, rare in human infantsIodine deficiency: iodine is a major component of thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)Infants with high intestinal losses can develop hypothyroidismEven with human milk fortification, iodine content remains below intake recommendations for preterm infantsParenteral iodine intake of 1 micrograms/kg/day is recommended for preterm infantsThe current US neonatal parenteral trace mineral product does not contain iodine

### POTENTIAL TOXICITIES OF TRACE MINERAL SUPPLEMENTATION IN NEONATES

Zinc toxicity: potential Cu and iron deficiencyCu toxicity: potential hepatotoxicityAcute Cu toxicity in preterm infants is rare, even with cholestasisChronic excessive intake or reduced biliary excretion can result in hepatic cirrhosis and hepatotoxic cell injury (increased alanine aminotransferase)Manganese toxicity: potential neurotoxicityManganese (Mn) supplementation stopped with any signs of hepatic dysfunction or cholestasisMn toxicity can still occur without hepatic dysfunction, because Mn is a common contaminant in PN solutions

Enteral Nutrition

WILLIAM W. HAY JR and KENDRA HENDRICKSON

# Human Milk

- Ideal enteral diet for human neonates:
- Human milk provides sufficient energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, micronutrients, and water for normal metabolism, growth, and development in term infants.
- Requires supplements of protein and certain minerals.

- Contraindications to the use of human milk are rare.
- Breastfeeding should be restricted in mothers with untreated maternal miliary tuberculosis or brucellosis; active herpes virus lesions on the breast; acute H1N1 pneumonia, acute varicella, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; in infants with congenital galactosemia; and in infants whose mothers are taking antimetabolites.
- Relative contraindications: breastfeeding in mothers with drug abuse (e.g., narcotics, phencyclidine, cocaine, cannabis, etc.).
- Mothers who test positive for such drugs should be enrolled in drug reduction programs rather than stopping breastfeeding, particularly among mothers with preterm infants, in whom the advantages of mother's milk generally outweigh the risks of addiction and neurodevelopmental defects in the infant.

- The development of a beneficial gastrointestinal (GI) flora, characterized by a large prevalence of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, is supported by human milk feedings.
- Human milk provides a variety of antimicrobial factors, such as secretory immunoglobulins (IgA), leukocytes, complement, lactoferrin, and lysozyme that protect against infections and Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC).
- Human milk contains hormones and growth factors such as epidermal and nerve growth factors, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and II, erythropoietin, prolactin, calcitonin, steroids, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), and thyroxine, which promote organ maturation, growth, and health.
- Several essential and conditionally essential amino acids (AAs) present in high concentrations in human milk promote gut growth and development.
- The protein and fat components of human milk are readily digestible, and human milk contains large numbers of enzymes that aid in nutrient digestion and processing (e.g., lipase).
- Exclusive human milk feeding of infants at high risk may reduce the risk for developing atopic disease or milk protein allergy in infancy.
- Human milk is advantageous for enhancing neurodevelopment, including vision, mental scales (particularly cognition), motor scales, behavior, and hearing.
- Preterm infants breastfed at discharge have less subnormal neurodevelopment at 2–5 years.

- These effects last into infancy, childhood, and adolescence.
- There are psychological benefits to a mother who provides her own milk to her infant.

&gt; "Human milk is the recommended basis of nutrition for the preterm infant: all preterm infants should receive human milk; human milk should be fortified with protein, minerals, and vitamins to ensure optimal nutrient intake for infants weighing &lt;1500 g at birth; and pasteurized donor human milk, appropriately fortified, should be used if mother's own milk is unavailable or its use is contraindicated."

AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS (AAP)

# COMPOSITION OF BREAST MILK: MOTHER OF PRETERM INFANT AND MOTHER OF FULL-TERM INFANT

- Preterm infant will not grow at the normal rate of fetal growth on human milk alone, because of the greater needs for protein and salts to promote growth at in utero rates.
- Protein content is higher in preterm mother's colostrum and milk right after birth, compared with term mother's milk.
- Milk from mothers of preterm infants has more sodium initially than milk obtained at term.
- Mother's milk can support adequate growth in larger and healthier preterm infants who have the capacity to take in larger volumes (usually &gt;200 mL/kg/day).
- Important when feeding preterm infants with donor human milk
- Donor human milk has lower protein and salt concentrations than early preterm mother's milk

# DIFFERENCES IN THE NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF HUMAN MILK AND INFANT FORMULAS

- Unfortified mature preterm human milk is lower in nutrient density and protein content than commonly used preterm formulas.
- Major nutrient compositions for mature preterm milk and preterm formulas (Table 25.1).
- Preterm formulas are higher than mature, unfortified human milk for contents of calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, chloride, iron, zinc, magnesium.
- Mature human milk and donor milk should be fortified with standard fortifiers to approximate the mineral compositions of preterm formulas to ensure adequate growth and development.

ARA, Arachidonic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; MCT, medium-chain triglycerides.

- Preterm formulas are higher than mature, unfortified human milk for vitamins A, D, E, K, C, riboflavin,  $\mathrm{B}_6$ , and folic acid.
- Standard multivitamin is used for preterm infants fed their own mother's milk or donor milk to ensure adequate metabolism, growth, and development.

# IMMUNOLOGIC AND ANTI INFECTIVE CONSTITUENTS IN HUMAN MILK AND THEIR EFFECTS

Lactoferrin (LF) and LF-iron-binding capacity:

LF has bacteriostatic function in the intestinal mucosa of the newborn:

- Chelates iron and prevents growth of various pathogens
- Direct cytotoxic effect against bacteria, viruses, and fungi
- Immunomodulatory functions

Assists to limit excessive immune responses:

Inhibits inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL6, IL8, Tumor Necrosis Factor [TNF]-α)
Stimulates activity and development of the immune system

Part of LF's activity attributed to the formation of lactoferricin:

- Potent cationic peptide with bactericidal activity formed during the digestion of LF

IgA is responsible for  $80\% - 90\%$  of total immunoglobulins in human milk.

IgA acts locally on the intestine as a first line of defense directed at foreign antigens, which include:

- Commensal or pathogenic microorganisms
- Toxins, viruses, and other antigenic materials (lipopolysaccharide)

Prevents their adherence and penetration into the epithelium without triggering inflammatory reactions that could be harmful to the newborn (immune exclusion)

High-affinity dimeric IgA antibodies inactivate viruses (e.g., rotavirus).
IgM: high avidity IgM antibodies react with viruses and bacteria to protect the mucosal surfaces of infants.
- Acts via agglutination and complement activation
IgG is found at low concentrations in human milk.
Neutralizing and opsonizing activity
- Activate the complement system and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity
IgG 1, 2, and 3 activate phagocytosis
IgG4 is anti inflammatory (responding to allergens)

Lactoperoxidase: in the presence of hydrogen peroxide catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate (present in saliva), forming hypothiocyanite that can kill both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
Lysozyme enzyme activity: capable of degrading the outer wall of gram-positive bacteria.
Lysozyme ability to kill gram-negative bacteria in vitro (synergistically with LF).
Lysozyme may have antiviral activity.

Human milk contains a variety of live cells including:
- Macrophages, T cells, stem cells, lymphocytes with anti infective and immunologically protective functions
Human milk contains large amounts of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs).
HMOs: prebiotic agents encourage the growth of beneficial (probiotic) organisms
Human milk contains many hundreds to thousands of distinct bioactive molecules that protect against infection and inflammation and contribute to immune maturation, organ development, and healthy microbial colonization.

# HUMAN MILK: THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSING METHODS

- Mother's own milk can be produced at home or produced in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and stored.
- Varying degrees of nutrient loss may occur with long-term storage.

---

<!-- Page 185 -->

Depends on the nutrient and the storage methodsFor majority of human milk components: significant degradation occurs only with long-term storage and multiple freeze-thaw cycles (reduce bactericidal capacity).Vitamin C loss occurs rapidly.Even in process of feeding freshly expressed human milk by bottle Donor milk.Donated human breast milk can contain pathogenic microorganisms that could be transferred to the infants, requiring sterilization procedures to ensure its safety.Such procedures diminish or destroy many nutritional and immunologic components of milk. Heat treatment (pasteurization) of human milk: the most common approach for sterilization.May reduce concentration and functional capacity of many bioactive components.Boiling is most damaging.Holder pasteurization (62°C for 30 minutes).Method used by the milk banks associated with the Human Milk Banking Association of North America.Does not adversely affect the protein content of donor milk.Flash-heat treatment may preserve bacteriostatic activity of donor milk more than the other methods. Pasteurization significantly reduces all classes of immunoglobulin.IgA, lysozyme, LF, Bile Salt Stimulated Lipase (BSSL), cytokines (most are antiinflammatory), lipases, macrophage inflammatory protein, TGF-b, and growth factor proteins (insulin, adiponectin, and erythropoietin). Overall: considerable variability in the assessment of biologic activity both before and after pasteurization.Total lipid generally is reduced (up to 60%), but Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) are increased.Pasteurization is damaging to fat content of donor milk compared to multiple freeze-thaw cycles.No significant reductions in lactose have been noted.Higher heat sensitivity noted for water-soluble vitamins (vitamin C).Less so for fat-soluble vitamins Zinc concentrations unchanged: activity impaired by denaturation of zinc binding proteins.

### HUMAN MILK FORTIFICATION

Extremely-low-birth-weight (ELBW) infants require increased nutrient supplies than are provided with maternal or donor milk due to:lower minimal energy reserves (carbohydrate stores in glycogen, fat in adipose tissue, protein in muscle);intrinsically higher metabolic rate (greater relative mass of more metabolically active organs: brain, heart, liver);higher protein turnover rates (especially when growing);higher glucose needs for energy and brain metabolism;higher lipid needs to match the in utero rate of fat deposition;excessive evaporative rates (immature skin);high urinary water and solute losses (depends on intake and renal maturation);low rates of gastrointestinal peristalsis;limited production of gut digestive enzymes and growth factors;higher incidence of stressful events (hypoxemia, respiratory distress, sepsis);metabolic effects of medications (steroids, antibiotics, sedatives, catecholamines);abnormal neurologic outcome if not fed adequately. Recommended daily requirements for energy, protein, calcium, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, and several vitamins necessary to meet the normal rate of in utero growth usually not achieved in the growing “healthy” preterm infant, fed with unsupplemented human milk, unless feeding milk volume feeds >200--250 mL/kg/day.Preterm infants with respiratory distress, infection, excessive heat losses, GI disorders, or surgery have even greater nutritional needs. Most new formulations of commercially available fortifiers use hydrolyzed cow's milk protein: may lead to less GI intolerance, less protein allergy (GI inflammation), and NEC.

### PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HUMAN MILK PRODUCTION AND SECRETION

Anatomy and function Mammary tissue includes alveoli (small sacs made of milk-secreting cells) and excretory ductsMilk collects in the lumen of the alveoli and ducts between feedingsThe alveoli: surrounded by myoepithelial cells that contract in response to tactile stimulation (suckling, manual expression) and oxytocin to produce milk flow along the ductsEach nipple has an average of nine milk ducts surrounded by muscle fibers and nervesMontgomery glands within the pigmented areola surrounding the nipple secrete an oily fluid that protects the skin of the nipple and areola during lactation, and produce the mother's individual scent that attracts her baby to the breastThe ducts beneath the areola fill with milk and become wider during a feed (when the oxytocin reflex is active) Hormonal regulation of lactationProlactin secretion increases markedly during pregnancy and stimulates the growth and development of the mammary tissueMilk secretion is suppressed during pregnancy by the pregnancy hormones (progesterone and estrogen)After delivery: progesterone and estrogen decrease rapidly, allowing prolactin to stimulate milk secretionSuckling by the infant increases prolactin secretion and its stimulation of milk production in the alveoliProlactin concentrations: highest about 30 minutes after suckling beginsOxytocin is essential for establishing lactation by stimulating the myoepithelial cells around the alveoli to contract, thereby increasing milk flow through and out of the ducts

---

<!-- Page 186 -->

The oxytocin reflex: called “letdown reflex” or the “milk ejection reflex”Oxytocin is produced more quickly than prolactinIncreases flow of milk already in the breast alveoli and ducts, helps the infant to get the milk easilyOxytocin also stimulates uterine contractions (contributing to uterine pain during early suckling)Prolactin and oxytocin secretion increase in response to gentle areolar and nipple tactile stimulation, enhanced by skin-to-skin contact and promoting breastfeeding and emotional bondingA delay in breastfeeding of even 4 to 6 hours after birth may lead to breastfeeding failure, and early initiation of breast expression in mothers of preterm infants is equally important Preterm birth and milk production Mammogenesis and lactogenesis are limited in mothers who deliver early.Lactogenesis I: the development of the synthetic capability of the breast to produce milk-specific components (lactose, casein, and α-lactalbumin)Lactogenesis I: begins by 22 weeks of pregnancy with production of unique milk components from the lactocytesMilk production is limited immediately after birth (regardless of gestation).First 48 hours after term birth: production of colostrum is 37 to 169 g/day.Lactogenesis II: secretion of copious milk secretion, precedes the mother's sensation of milk coming into the breast (occurs between 24 to 102 hours after birth, average 59 to 64 hours)Lactogenesis II: requires adequate levels of prolactin, insulin, and adrenocorticoid hormones, is triggered by withdrawal of progesterone following delivery of the placenta Preterm infants can grasp the nipple with lips and tongue from 28 weeks' gestational age, and can suckle and remove some milk from nipple at 31 weeks.Coordination of suckling, swallowing, and breathing develops between 32 to 35 weeksMost preterm infants can breastfeed fully by 36 weeks Preterm birth is stressful and may lead to unsuccessful milk production if supportive nursing care, lactation counseling, encouragement by physicians, and provision of a calm, quiet, private environment are not provided.Many mothers delivering preterm infants have not breastfed previously and are not familiar with the sensations caused by the release of oxytocinInadequate milk production in some stressed mothers of very preterm infants could be caused by failure of milk ejection

## Problems Associated with Breast Milk Production in the NICU

### Common Problems and Strategies to Acquire and Feed Mother's Own Milk (MOM) in the NICU

Establishing a milk-friendly environment that promotes breast milk and breastfeeding.Assuring access to effective and efficient hospital-grade electric pumps, double collection kits, and customized breast shield sizing.Implementing breast pump use within 1 hour after birth.Avoidance of exclusive hand expression in the early days after birth.Monitoring pumped milk volume during the critical first 2 weeks after birth when breast-pump dependent mothers are at risk for long-lasting milk volume problems.Integrating NICU-based breastfeeding peer counselors as direct lactation care providers.Incorporating tested lactation technologies (milk analysis and test-weighing) to objectively manage growth on MOM feedings.Promoting breastfeeding and milk production right after birth of a preterm, sick infant.Promoting donor milk when MOM is not available and formula is not desired.Optimizing counseling of mothers, avoiding problems such as promoting discharge at the expense of breastfeeding and pumping breast milk emphasized over breastfeeding.Promoting kangaroo mother care and prenatal education to encourage breastfeeding and to enhance knowledge and perception of providing appropriate volumes.

## Advantages and disadvantages of the use of donor human milk

Donor human milk is a pasteurized product from accredited milk banks and used when maternal milk is insufficient or unavailable.Donor milk is pasteurized to prevent infections in the infant. Pasteurization removes most of the antiinfective properties of milk, reduces lipase activity, the content of live cells and microbes, and CMV virus.Infection rates and NEC rates are much lower with MOM and pasteurized donor milk than formulas.Donor milk in the United States is low in Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) content.Donor milk is an appropriate choice for Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW)/Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) preterm infants whose mother's milk is unavailable.Donor milk has >75% improvement in feeding tolerance compared with formulas.Rates of NEC and related sepsis may be lowest among very preterm infants fed with an exclusive human milk diet (compared with formula fed infants).

## Formulas

### Distribution of Nutrients in Infant Formulas

Formulas for term infants contain 20 kcal/ounce (oz) and are adequate to meet the needs of term infants with an intact GI tract and “normal” fluid requirementsPreterm formulas are available in 20, 24, and 30 kcal/oz preparations, with similar osmolalities and renal solute loadsNewer generations of high-protein preterm formulas containing ~2.8 grams/100 mL may be indicated for VLBW preterm infants, who are not growing well (in

length and/or head circumference), or who are fluid/ volume restricted

- Preterm formulas contain whey:casein ratios of 60:40 and have higher protein contents than those of term formulas (2.4 grams/100 mL in preterm formula versus 2 grams/100 mL in term formula or human milk)
- Preterm formulas
- Contain less lactose as a carbohydrate source
- Substitute glucose polymers or corn syrup solids for lactose to provide ~42%–44% of the calories derived from this carbohydrate
- Preterm formulas provide some fat in the form of Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) (ease of digestion and absorption)
- Calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) content is increased, with a Ca:P ratio of 1.8–2:1, provides for improved bone mineralization
- Other minerals and vitamins also present in higher concentrations in preterm formulas
- Mineral and vitamin content of preterm infant formulas (Table 25.2)

# BENEFITS AND RISKS OF FORMULAS THAT CONTAIN NONSTANDARD SOY PROTEINS

- Soy protein formulas reserved for term infants:
- With galactosemia, have severe lactose intolerance, have hereditary lactase deficiency
- Who are of vegan families (counselled on need for a balanced protein diet in their infant)
- With an IgE-mediated cow’s milk protein allergy
- Soy-derived formulas are not used for preterm infants due to poor quality of protein, lower digestibility and bioavailability, and lower calcium and zinc accretion rates
- There are concerns for all infants about the concentrations of phytates, aluminum, and phytoestrogens that are in soy formulas
- For term infants: formulas derived from protein hydrolysates are reserved for infants who are allergic to cow’s milk proteins and are not breastfed, or do not tolerate soy-derived formulas
- Soy formulas have no role in the prevention of atopic disease
- Extensively hydrolyzed formulas may delay or prevent atopic dermatitis in infants at high risk and who are not breastfed
- Families with a strong history of cow milk protein allergy
- Encouraged to breastfeed
- Appropriate counseling of mother in avoiding cow milk products in her diet

# MEDICAL INDICATIONS FOR NONSTANDARD INFANT FORMULAS

- Elemental and extensively hydrolyzed formulas
- Used in infants with malabsorption, severe liver disease, Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS), dysmotility syndromes (e.g., in gastroschisis), or severe protein allergy
- The protein source: derived from free AAs
- Fat source: derived from MCT oil (0%–55%)
- Many are lactose free
- Elemental or hydrolyzed formulas: may be useful after a severe episode of infectious gastroenteritis with mucosal injury and resulting protein or lactose intolerance
- Preterm infants fed partially hydrolyzed whey preterm infant formula
- No benefit in feeding tolerance, enteral intake, or growth
- Modified formulas are available for infants with special nutritional needs due to inherited enzyme deficiencies
- Lactose intolerance from congenital lactase deficiency, galactosemia, and PKU
- These formulas require multivitamin and mineral supplements (if used for preterm infants)
- Some preterm infants have apparent cow milk protein “allergy” (feeding intolerance, intestinal dilation, hematochezia without other signs of illness or NEC)
- These infants may benefit from reduction in maternal cow milk protein diet or use of hydrolyzed cow milk protein fortifiers (mother is breastfeeding) or use of hydrolyzed cow milk protein formulas

# STANDARD INFANT FORMULA MODIFICATIONS FOR USE IN PRETERM INFANTS

- Preterm formulas are developed to meet the unique nutritional needs of preterm infants (though most were not specifically tested in ELBW infants)
- Indications for use of high protein preterm formulas include
- Birth weight &lt;1500 g
- Infants who are fluid/volume restricted (congenital heart disease and Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia [BPD])
- Promotion of wound healing (postoperative)
- Cumulative deficit of protein intake (early Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) weaning before full enteral feeding established)
- Inadequate growth in length and/or head circumference (treated with liquid protein supplements)
- Unfortified human milk feeds (e.g., direct breastfeeding or use of donor milk)
- Lactose usually is reduced due to concern for early lactase deficiency
- The remaining carbohydrate is provided by glucose polymers (easily digested) and provide a lower osmolality (~300 mOsm/L)
- Fat blends include 20% to 50% MCTs to compensate for lower bile salts and lipases
- Protein concentrations are increased to 2.7–3.3 g/100 kcal and are whey predominant

- Calcium and phosphorus vitamins and other minerals are increased
- Carnitine commonly added to aid in lipid oxidation
- Increasing caloric density or goal volumes addresses most growth concerns, but it may also be necessary to provide additional individual nutrients (protein, minerals, zinc, sodium)

Parenteral Nutrition

WILLIAM W. HAY JR and KENDRA HENDRICKSON

# Indications of Parenteral Nutrition

- The more preterm and less developed the infant, the less body stores (protein, fat, glycogen) are available to provide nutrients for metabolic needs.
- Intravenous feeding is always indicated when normal metabolic needs are not met by normal enteral feeding.
- The metabolic and nutrient requirements of the newborn are equal to or greater than those of the fetus of the same gestational age.
- Intravenous feeding is essential, but it should not be a sole substitute for enteral nutrition unless the infant has absolutely no capacity for enteral feedings.
- These conditions are rare (usually short-term) and include:
- Intestinal obstructions (atresia or totally obstructing bands), malformations (gastroschisis, severe omphalocele), or early gut infarctions and perforations.
- These infants may be able to feed enterally in small amounts.
- Parenteral nutrition is important to ensure full protein and energy supplies to maintain neuronal development.
- In the first week of life: protein and energy intakes are associated with improved developmental outcomes in preterm infants at 18 months of age.
- In the first three weeks of life: protein and energy intakes are associated with greater adult lean body mass and higher resting energy expenditure.

# Composition and Energy Content

## NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF PARENTERAL SOLUTIONS

- Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a combination of nutrients: dextrose, crystalline amino acids, fat emulsion, sterile water, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals administered intravenously.
- In neonates, fat emulsion is administered in a separate syringe in a two-in-one formulation.
- PN calories are increased as tolerated to a goal caloric intake of 90–115 kcal/kg/day as a combination of macronutrient components.
- Dextrose solutions are usually 5% or 10% dextrose weight/volume in solution, with other concentrations added as needed with average glucose infusion rate of 5–10 mg/kg/min.

- Crystalline amino acids (AAs) are provided in stock solutions ranging from 3% to 20%, (i.e., a 3% amino acid solution has 3 grams of total amino acids in 100 mL of solution).
- Average daily AA 3–4 g/kg/day.
- Pediatric formulations contain higher concentrations of branched-chain AAs (leucine, isoleucine, valine) and decreased amounts of methionine and phenylalanine.
- Neonates have additional AAs that are considered conditionally essential (tyrosine, glutamine, arginine, cysteine, glycine, proline).
- Cysteine added at the time of compounding due to stability issues.
- Intravenous fat emulsion is used to provide energy and essential fatty acids for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) formulations.
- Lipid emulsions should be 20% solutions (20 g/100 mL) to minimize phospholipid content and improve clearance.
- In the United States 100% soybean oil or a combination product using several oil sources is available for use in TPN, with a fish oil product being recently FDA approved.

- Electrolytes are added based on fluid status and laboratory values as salts that also provide acetate, chloride, and phosphorus.
- Calcium is provided in the form of calcium gluconate.
- Cysteine, carnitine, and some medications may also be added.
- PN can contain up to 40 different nutrient components that impact stability and compatibility.

## IMPORTANCE OF PROTEIN AND NONPROTEIN NUTRIENTS TO ACHIEVE OPTIMAL ENERGY

- Even at standard infusion rates, protein accretion rates with current TPN solutions with lower concentrations of certain essential amino acids (e.g., leucine, isoleucine, threonine, lysine) limit protein accretion.
- The amino acid composition of current neonatal parenteral amino acid solutions is based on providing plasma concentrations similar to those of term, fully breastfed infants.
- Preterm infants require considerably greater amounts of amino acids to achieve their higher gestational age-appropriate protein accretion rates.
- At lower, nonprotein calorie intakes (&lt;60–70 kcal/kg/day), increasing energy intakes promote net protein accretion rates.

Nutrition

- Energy intake &gt;60–70 kcal/kg/day produces fat gain but not protein accretion.
- The relationship between energy intake and protein accretion is curvilinear.
- In contrast, protein accretion at any caloric (energy) intake is directly dependent on protein intake (either as intact protein in enteral diets or as amino acids in TPN solutions).

# CALCULATE THE CALORIC CONTENT OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION SOLUTIONS

- Protein concentrations in parenteral nutrition are ordered as g/kg/day.
- Amino acids produce about 4 kcal/g of energy if totally oxidized.
- Therefore the amount of amino acids g/kg/day received can be multiplied by 4 to determine kcal/kg/day.
- Glucose produces about 4 kcal/g of energy if totally oxidized; therefore the total: g/kg/day × 4 will provide the calories/kg/day.
- Lipids emulsions are usually infused separately and ordered as g/kg/day.
- Lipids produce about 10 kcal/g of energy if totally oxidized.
- The ordered amount of g/kg/day × 10 provides the kcal/kg/day from fat.
- A standard parenteral infusion of 3 g/kg/day amino acids and 10% dextrose at 100 mL/kg/day would provide:
- Total energy intake of 82 kcal/kg/day
- 52 kcal/kg/day
- 3 grams amino acids × 4 kcal/gram = 12 kcal
- 10 grams of dextrose × 4 kcal/gram = 40 kcal
- 30 kcal/kg/day: 3 grams/kg/day of lipid

# Complications of Parenteral Nutrition

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS CONTENT OF PN SOLUTIONS AND OSTEOPENIA

- Intravenous calcium and phosphorus supplementation should be started in high-risk infants soon after birth.
- The usual dosing range of parenteral calcium in the form of calcium gluconate is 0.6–2.5 mmol/kg/day (25–100 mg/kg/day of elemental calcium), and the dose is titrated based on either the total serum calcium level or ionized calcium level.
- Phosphorus is given as sodium phosphate with a dosing range of 0.75 to 2.5 mmol/kg/day (25–80 mg/kg/day of phosphate).
- The Ca/P ratio should preferentially be kept at 11.3–1:1 on a molar basis and 1.3 to 1.7/1 on a mg/mg basis to maximize accretion of both minerals.
- The solubility of calcium and phosphorus in TPN solutions depends on temperature (better at higher temperatures), amino acid concentrations (better with higher concentration), glucose concentration, pH, type of calcium salt, sequence of addition of calcium and phosphorus to the solution, the calcium and phosphorus ratio, and the presence of lipid.

- Adding cysteine to enhance protein balance lowers the pH and improves calcium and phosphorus solubility.
- Caution should be taken if calcium is infused into a peripheral IV catheter, as severe tissue necrosis and sloughing can occur with extravasations and even minor leaks.
- Some intensive care units avoid peripheral calcium administration entirely except in emergencies, such as hypocalcemic seizures or shock.
- Magnesium supplementation ranges from 0.12–0.4 mmol/kg/day (3–10 mg/kg/day).

## ASSOCIATION OF CHOLESTASIS WITH TPN NUTRITION

- Cholestasis or parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) more common in:
- Extremely preterm infants
- Infant with short gut syndromes (receive parenteral nutrition exclusively and for prolonged periods)
- PNALD is first noticed by increased direct (conjugated) bilirubin concentrations, which should be measured at least weekly.
- PNALD is reduced by any enteral nutrition.
- PNALD is markedly reduced in frequency with use of newer lipid emulsions that contain less soybean oil and can be reversed with lipid emulsions that contain fish oil or a combination of omega-3 rich oils.
- These emulsions also have antiinflammatory DHA and vitamin E.
- Phytosterols that are high in soybean oils have been shown independently to cause or worsen liver inflammation and cholestatic disease.

## CAUSES AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATION OF CATHETER COMPLICATIONS OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION

- Peripheral IV lines: can be used for parenteral nutrition, although usually are limited in both dextrose (12.5%) and amino acid concentrations (3%) to prevent local skin and subcutaneous skin inflammation and necrosis with common extravasations.
- Adding heparin to these catheters limits clotting and prolongs catheter lifetime.
- Umbilical vein catheters are associated with air embolism during placement (rare), sepsis (if kept in &gt;5–7 days), and hemorrhage (can dislodge).
- Percutaneously inserted central catheters (PICC) are commonly used for long-term central venous access.
- Major risk factors involve thrombosis and erosion of the catheter tips extravascularly, producing complications of pleural effusion with lung collapse and pericardial effusions with cardiac tamponade.
- Any prolonged IV line (&gt;5–7 days), more commonly with central lines, increases the risk of invasive bacterial infection and systemic sepsis.
- Sepsis can be reduced by a common insertion and management protocol by only highly skilled and practiced caregivers with use of meticulous sterile precautions for insertion and care.
- These lines should not be used for blood sampling or other drug infusions except during major life-threatening crises.

Parenteral Nutrition
153

# CAUSES AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION

- The principal metabolic complication of parenteral nutrition is hyperglycemia.
- This problem has increased in recent years and has been associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality.
- Most preterm infants as well as term infants continue to produce glucose from their livers at about 2–3 mg/kg/min.
- If the parenteral dextrose infusion rate is &gt;7–9 mg/kg/min, then total glucose utilization capacity will be exceeded, resulting in progressively increasing glucose concentrations.

- Hyperglycemia from excessive dextrose infusion is compounded by stress with increased production of catecholamines, glucagon, and cortisol, which suppress or limit insulin secretion and action and increase hepatic glucose production.

- Excessive dosing of IV lipids also aggravates hyperglycemia by providing competitive lipid carbon for oxidation, and by producing co-factors in the liver from beta-oxidation of fatty acids that promote the regulatory enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway.

- Preterm infants also often develop hypertriglyceridemia (150 to 200 mg/dL).
- Hypertriglyceridemia is increased by maturational deficiency of lipases (inversely related to gestational age), low levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT, the protein necessary for transfer of longer chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation and energy production), and competition from glucose carbon (commonly associated hyperglycemic conditions).
- Risks of hypertriglyceridemia can be diminished significantly by enteral feeding of milk or preterm formulas, which have natural or added carnitine as well as lipases in human milk.

- The principal metabolic complication of IV amino acid solutions is lower than needed plasma concentrations of essential and some conditionally essential amino acids.

- High amino acid concentrations generally are the result of excessive and unnecessary infusion rates (&gt;4.0 g/kg/day) and limited urinary excretion, although caution should be used in giving high infusion rates to infants with clearly damaged liver function from hypoxic-ischemic injury.

- Blood urea nitrogen concentrations and ammonia concentrations should increase by small amounts with increased amino acid infusion rates if the amino acids are appropriately oxidized producing ammonia and the liver is functioning well to remove ammonia through the urea cycle.

# POTENTIAL TOXICITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION

- Manganese (Mn) can produce potential neurotoxicity, as Mn is a common contaminant in PN solutions.
- Mn supplementation stopped with any signs of hepatic dysfunction or cholestasis
- Parenteral calcium gluconate to prevent osteopenia contributes to Mn contamination and potential toxicity

- Phytosterols and low antioxidant factors (e.g., DHA and vitamin E) can lead to cholestasis.

- There is significant aluminum contamination in albumin, blood products, certain medications, and TPN components.
- Premature infants are at high risk of aluminum accumulation and toxicity as they often require PN for many days and have immature kidneys incapable of excreting aluminum efficiently.
- Calcium gluconate and phosphate salts are high in aluminum content and are required by premature infants in substantial amounts to promote bone mineralization.
- The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set limits for aluminum content of TPN components, but manufacturers are often unable to meet these restrictions and health care providers should make a concerted effort to use the least contaminated products.
- A readily available substitution is using sodium phosphate in preference to potassium phosphate.

Water-Electrolyte Metabolism and Acid-Base Balance

ERIN RADEMACHER

# Water Metabolism

- Total body water (TBW) is expressed as a percentage of body weight in kg. It decreases from ~95% of total weight at 16 weeks' gestation to 75% total weight at 40 weeks (Fig. 27.1).
- TBW is divided into intracellular water and extracellular water (ECW). ECW is further divided into interstitial space and intravascular space. The percentage of TBW contained in the ECW declines with gestational age (GA). At term birth, almost 50% of TBW is intracellular.
- ECW decreases after birth. Term infants typically lose ~5%–10% of birth weight over the first 4–7 days. Preterm infants can lose 15% over the first 5–10 days. Failure to lose ECW is associated with increased risk of PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), NEC (necrotizing enterocolitis), and BPD (bronchopulmonary dysplasia).
- Before delivery, fluid shifts from intravascular to interstitial space.
- After birth, fluid shifts back into intravascular space over the first few days resulting in release of ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) with resulting loss of water and sodium from kidney and loss of TBW.
- Maintenance water requirement = urine volume + other losses (stool typically 5–10 mL/kg/day, emesis, drains) + insensible water loss + amount needed for tissue generation (10–15 mL/kg/d).
- The best indicators of appropriate fluid prescription are stable sodium levels and appropriate weight gain (or loss in the first week).
- See Table 27.1 for guidelines for water needs for different GA/postnatal ages.
- Insensible water losses (IWL) = water lost through skin (two-thirds total) and respiration (one-third total).
- Preterm infants have increased skin losses due to an immature epithelial layer, increased body surface area:body weight ratio, and increased skin vascularity. Administration of steroids prenatally accelerates skin maturation and can decrease skin losses.
- IWL will be increased/decreased under different conditions (Table 27.2).
- Arginine vasopressin (AVP, ADH, vasopressin) is the major effector involved in water metabolism. It is synthesized in hypothalamus and stored in posterior pituitary gland.
- A rise in plasma osmolality (sensed by osmoreceptors in hypothalamus) or a fall in intravascular volume (detected by baroreceptors in the heart) leads to release of AVP.

- Intravascular volume depletion trumps plasma osmolality if the two stimuli are in opposing directions.
- AVP acts on its receptor, vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R), which is located on the basolateral (blood side) of distal tubules and collecting duct cells in the nephron.
- Binding of AVP to V2R stimulates adenylate cyclase leading to increased levels of cAMP and eventually fusion of vesicles containing the water channel aquaporin (AQP2) to the apical membrane (urine side), which allows water to move from the urinary space into the cell.
- When AVP levels fall, the AQP2 is recycled back out of the apical membrane into vesicles.
- Two other effectors of water metabolism: thirst and angiotensin II (which stimulates thirst).
- Maximal urine concentrating ability is ~600 mOsm/kg in preterm, 800 mOsm/kg in term, and reaches adult levels of 1200 mOsm/kg by 6–12 months.
- Preterm infants are unable to generate/maintain the countercurrent mechanism critical to concentrating urine due to immature tubules and short loops of Henle that do not reach the inner medulla.
- Full-term infants can maximally dilute urine (50 mOsm/kg). Preterm have slightly impaired dilution ability (70 mOsm/kg).

#### Diagnosis/Evaluation

- Urine osmolality &gt; serum osmolality.
- Urine sodium &gt;20 mEq/L.
- Normal thyroid, kidney, adrenal function.

#### Treatment

- Fluid restriction is of primary importance.

SODIUM METABOLISM

Positive Na balance is required for growth.After first 24--48 hours, Na requirement generally 1--2 mEq/kg/d for days of life 3--7 then increases after first week to 2--3 mEq/kg/d.Premature infants (GA <28 weeks) may require much higher Na intake (4--10 mEq/kg/d) due to immature tubules leading to renal Na wasting.Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) in term infant <1% while FENa of preterm (<30 week GA) may be >5%.Some trials suggest Na supplementation associated with better long-term neurodevelopment in preterm infants.Na reabsorbed from tubular lumen via transporters or channels in the apical membrane (urine side) throughout the nephron and then pumped out of the cell via the Na-K ATPase on the basolateral membrane (blood side). Na-K ATPase critical to this process. Activity is lower in neonates than adults (Fig. 27.2).In neonates, the proximal tubule reabsorbs ~50%--60% (similar to adult capacity) of the filtered Na via Na/H exchanger or Na-X cotransporter (X = glucose, amino acid, or phosphate). Na/H exchanger activity is lower in neonates than adults.Thick ascending limb of loop of Henle (LoH) reabsorbs Na via Na-K-2Cl channel (furosemide sensitive).Distal convoluted tubule (DCT) reabsorbs Na via Na-Cl cotransporter (thiazide sensitive).Cortical collecting duct (CCD) reabsorbs Na via ENaC (epithelial Na channel) under control of aldosterone.Maturation of the nephron during fetal development and after birth allows increased reabsorption of Na from the distal LoH and distal segments.Na-K ATPase and the proximal tubule Na transporters increased by thyroid hormone and glucocorticoid.LoH's Na-K-2Cl channel and DCT's Na-Cl increased by glucocorticoids.

## Disorders of SODIUM METABOLISM

### Hyponatremia

Usually defined as Na <130 mEq/L.Occurs in 30% of VLBW in 1st week, 25%--65% develop later.Three mechanisms lead to hyponatremia (Fig. 27.3):Inability to excrete water load most common cause. This may be due to a decrease in effective blood volume providing a stimulus for ADH release. May also be due to decreased fluid delivery to distal nephron either from decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in acute kidney injury (AKI) or from increased proximal Na and water reabsorption in volume-depletion states.Excessive Na loss.May be physiologic (i.e. high FENa in preterm).Pathologic causes: see sections on congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pseudohypoaldosteronism, and Bartter syndrome.Inadequate intake.High maternal water intake during labor or oxytocin use may cause hyponatremia in the neonate.Correction estimated by: Na^{+} deficit (mEq) = 0.7 × body weight (kg) × (Na_{ desired} - Na_{ current}).Usually replaced as 2/3 in first 24 hours, remainder over next 24 hours.If Na <120 mEq/L, consider using 3% saline (513 mEq Na/L) to correct serum Na to 120 mEq/L over 4--6 hours, then replace remainder over 48 hours.

## Hypernatremia

Usually defined as Na >150 mEq/L.Occurs in 40% of preterm infants < 29 weeks.Mechanisms (Fig. 27.4).Increased water loss most common etiology. Often due to underestimated IWL. Inadequate breastfeeding and diarrhea other common causes.Excessive Na administration from medications or improperly prepared formula or TPN.Therapy.H_{2}O deficit (L) = 0.7 × weight (kg) × ([Na current/Na desired]-1).Correction should be slow (0.5 mEq/hr) in cases of chronic or unknown duration to avoid cerebral edema.With Na >175 mEq/L, may need to add 3% saline to IVF to make a fluid with Na 10--15 mEq/L less than the current serum Na.

## Potassium Metabolism

Transported actively across placenta from mother to fetus.Positive balance required for growth. Typically 1--2 mEq/kg/d after the first 48 hours of life; start supplementation after urine output well established.Infants have higher plasma levels than adults (average 5 versus 4 mEq/L).Potassium (K) shifts into/out of cells under certain conditions.Into cell: insulin, β2 agonists, metabolic alkalosis.Out of cell: α-adrenergic agonists, metabolic acidosis, hyperosmolality.Metabolic acidosis caused by mineral acid (HCl or NH4^{+}Cl) causes much larger shifts than organic anion acidosis (lactic acid, acetoacetic and β-hydroxybutyrate acids).Excretion mainly via kidneys; GI tract provides lesser mechanism.K freely filtered at glomerulus but then reabsorbed along the tubule.Renal excretion is by secretion in the distal nephron, mainly cortical collecting duct (Fig. 27.5). K enters cells via Na-K ATPase then exits to urine space via K channels.Secretion is affected by:Rate of distal Na delivery and the transepithelial voltage:When Na is avidly reabsorbed in proximal nephron due to intravascular volume depletion, less Na reaches the distal tubule. This results in deceased Na reabsorption via ENaC, which diminishes the electrochemical gradient that would favor K secretion into urine.Tubular flow rate: high flow rate stimulates K secretion in a mature kidney, but neonates lack these maxi-K channels.

- Plasma K level: higher plasma levels allow steeper gradient favoring entry from blood into distal tubule cells and subsequently secretion into lumen.
- Aldosterone stimulates epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and Na-K ATPase to reabsorb Na thus making

lumen more negative, which favors K secretion from cell. Neonates are relatively insensitive to aldosterone.

- Acid-base balance.
- Alkalosis stimulates K secretion via two mechanisms:

- Stimulation of Na-K ATPase and therefore K uptake into cell.
- Increases length of time K channels open on apical membrane to allow exit into urine.
- Acute metabolic acidosis inhibits K secretion by inhibiting apical K channel (ROMK).
- Chronic metabolic acidosis has variable effects on secretion.
- Hypokalemia: &lt;3.5 mEq/L.
- Seen with diuretics, diarrhea, renal dysfunction, NG drainage, alkalosis.
- EKG changes: flattened T waves, prolonged QT interval, U waves.
- Hyperkalemia: K &gt;6.5 mEq/L.
- Seen with renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, cell breakdown.
- EKG changes: peaked T waves, wide QRS, bradycardia, tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation.
- Therapy centers on shifting K into cells and stabilizing the myocardium as acute temporizing measures and elimination from body (see Table 27.3).

# ACID-BASE BALANCE

- Normal pH ranges between 7.35–7.45.
- Growth and development depend on acid-base balance.
- Mechanisms to keep pH in normal range include buffering systems that act acutely and compensatory systems to maintain balance chronically.
- Extracellular buffering system: carbonic acid-bicarbonate system most important. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the following reaction:

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+} + \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{CO}_{2}
$$

- Intracellular buffering systems:
- Hemoglobin, intracellular proteins, intracellular phosphate.
- Requires several hours to reach maximum capacity.
- Much of buffering is done in bones: chronic acidosis leads to increased bone resorption.

Table 27.3 Therapy of Hyperkalemia

[tbl-0.html](tbl-0.html)

From Gleason CA. Avery's Diseases of the Newborn. 9th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2012 [p. 379, Table 31.4].

- Respiratory compensatory mechanism:
- Immediate regulator of homeostasis by maintaining normal $\mathrm{PaCO}_2$ (arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide).
- Chemoreceptors (central more than peripheral) activated by change in pH or $\mathrm{PaCO}_2$.
- Develops within minutes for respiratory acidosis but takes several hours to develop for metabolic acidosis.
- Compensation for metabolic process is incomplete: pH does not normalize.
- Winters formula predicts the respiratory response to a primary metabolic acidosis:
$$
\mathrm{pCO}_2 = (1.5 \times \mathrm{HCO}_3^-) + 8 \pm 2
$$

- Renal compensatory mechanism:
- Starts within hours but takes days to reach its maximal effect.
- Secretion of $\mathrm{H^{+}}$ is the primary mechanism of urine acidification.
- Filtered bicarbonate is recycled back into cells as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ where it is reformed into bicarbonate and transported back into blood.

- Urinary acidification process:
- Proximal tubule:
- Adults reabsorb $70\% - 90\%$ of the filtered bicarbonate; neonates less.
- $\mathrm{H^{+}}$ is secreted into lumen via Na/H exchanger and $\mathrm{H^{+}}$ ATPase where it combines with the filtered bicarbonate via action of luminal CA to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which then diffuses back into cell. Cellular CA uses this $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to regenerate bicarbonate that is transported to blood along with Na (Fig. 27.6).

- Ammoniagenesis: results in net acid secretion via generation of $\mathrm{NH_4^+}$.
- Glutamine $\rightarrow \mathrm{NH}_4^+$ + $\alpha$-ketoglutarate.
- $\mathrm{NH}_4^+$ secreted into lumen via $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{NH}_4^+$ exchanger.
- $\alpha$-ketoglutarate buffers intracellular $\mathrm{H^{+}}$ and results in $\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$ that is transported to blood via $\mathrm{NaHCO}_3^-$ transporter.

- The fully mature tubule’s response to systemic acidosis is to:
- Increase proximal tubule cells, uptake of glutamine.
- Increase the number of Na/H exchangers on apical surface.
- Increase citrate reabsorption from lumen.
- Decrease phosphate reabsorption.

- Thick ascending limb (TAL) and distal tubule:
- Reabsorbs $20\%$ of the filtered bicarbonate.
- TAL takes up secreted $\mathrm{NH}_4^+$ by proximal tubule to store in medullary interstitium where it can be secreted by collecting duct.

- Collecting duct (Fig. 27.7):
- Type A intercalated cells have $\mathrm{H^{+}}$ ATPase on apical membrane to secrete $\mathrm{H^{+}}$ into the lumen where it combines with filtered anions ($\mathrm{PO_4^-}$ and sulfates) to form titratable acids.
- Metabolic acidosis leads to increased insertion of preformed $\mathrm{H^{+}}$ ATPase.
- Also secretes $\mathrm{NH}_3$ from medullary interstitium, which combines with secreted $\mathrm{H^{+}}$ to form $\mathrm{NH}_4^+$.
- Type B intercalated cells secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$ via $\mathrm{Cl^-}/\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$ exchanger.

27 Water-Electrolyte Metabolism and Acid-Base Balance

![img-4.jpeg](images/page0502_img-4.jpg)
Fig. 27.6 Proximal tubule reabsorption of bicarbonate and secretion of ammonium. (From Martin RJ. Fanaroff and Martin's Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine. 10th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier/Saunders; 2015 [p. 622, Fig. 44.4].)

- Maximal urinary acidification in mature kidney results in a urine pH of 4.5–5; preterm kidney can only reach a urine pH of 6.

- Regulation of acid-base in neonate:
- Mild metabolic acidosis is normal shortly after birth, due to maternal respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation of pregnancy), which stimulates a compensatory metabolic acidosis in mother.
- Growing children produce 1–2 mEq/kg/day of nonvolatile acid.
- Respiratory compensation: effectiveness depends on maturity of central respiratory control system and lung function. Preterm infants have decreased sensitivity to changes in CO₂.
- Renal compensation:
- Immature tubules result in decreased ability to reclaim the filtered bicarbonate, which contributes to the lower serum bicarbonate levels seen in neonates.
- Urinary excretion of titratable acid and NH₄⁺ also increases with GA.
- By 1 month after delivery, regardless of GA, distal tubular H⁺ secretion present.
- Neonatal metabolic acidosis:
- Causes: increased nonvolatile acid or decreased HCO₃⁻ in extracellular fluid (ECF) (Box 27.1).
- Categorized by high or normal anion gap (AG).

- AG = Na – (Cl + HCO₃⁻)
- Normal value varies with lab, usually 8–16.
- For every decrease by 1 g/dL albumin, AG decreases by 2.5 mEq/L.
- Increased AG may not be present in neonates with lactic acidosis.
- Treatment.
- Removing inciting event.
- Alkali (Na bicarbonate) use is controversial. Requires adequate ventilation; other complications include fluid overload, hypernatremia, cerebral vasoconstriction, decreased O₂ delivery to brain due to shift in oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, intracellular acidosis due to CO₂ diffusion into cells.
- Full correction = base deficit (mEq/L) × body weight (kg) × 0.3. Usually give 50% of calculated dose and reassess.

# Box 27.1 Causes of Metabolic Acidosis in Neonates

## Increased Anion Gap

### Lactic Acidosis
- Hypoxemia, shock, sepsis
- Inborn errors of carbohydrate or pyruvate metabolism
- Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency
- Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency
- Mitochondrial respiratory chain defects
- Renal failure

### Ketoacidosis
- Glycogen storage disease (type I)
- Inborn errors of amino acid or organic acid metabolism

## Normal Anion Gap
- Bicarbonate loss: acute diarrhea; drainage from small bowel, biliary, or pancreatic tube; fistula drainage; bowel augmentation cystoplasty; ureteral diversion with bowel
- Renal tubular acidosis
- Mineralocorticoid deficiency
- Administration of Cl⁻-containing compounds: arginine HCl, HCl, CaCl₂, MgCl₂, NH₄Cl hyperalimentation, high-protein formula
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
- Dilution of extracellular fluid compartment

From Martin RJ. Fanaroff and Martin's Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine. 10th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier/Saunders; 2015 [p. 624, Box 44.1]. Adapted from Brewer E. Disorders of acid-base balance. Pediatr Clin North Am. 1990;37:429.

- Na or K acetate may be used to treat chronic acidosis, can be added to TPN.
- Neonatal respiratory acidosis:
- Results from decreased excretion of CO₂ due to primary lung disease and V/Q mismatch; may require mechanical ventilation to increase excretion of CO₂.
- Preterm infants respond with increased respiratory rate with only small increase in tidal volume; term infants respond with increased tidal volume.
- Renal compensation is limited by immature tubules' inability to reclaim more filtered bicarbonate.

Box 27.2 Common Causes of Metabolic Alkalosis in Neonates

Acid loss: vomiting (e.g. pyloric stenosis), nasogastric suctionDiureticsChloride deficiency: chronic chloride-losing diarrhea, Bartter syndrome, low-chloride formula, loss via skin secondary to cystic fibrosisAdministration of alkali: bicarbonate, lactate, acetate, citrate

From Martin RJ. Fanaroff and Martin's Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine. 10th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier/Saunders; 2015 [p. 625, Box 44.2].

Administration of alkali not indicated as increased serum HCO_{3}^{-} stimulates hypoventilation. Neonatal metabolic alkalosis (Box 27.2):Most commonly seen in neonatal intensive care unit with prolonged diuretic use.Other causes: loss of H^{+} from GI tract (vomiting, NG suction) or kidneys, exogenous bicarbonate, contraction of extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) around a fixed amount of HCO_{3}^{-} (have lost more Cl^{-} than HCO_{3}^{-}).May be maintained by continued decrease in ECV, which:Leads to decrease in GFR and less filtered bicarbonate.Stimulates avid proximal Na reabsorption, which leads to HCO_{3}^{-} reabsorption.Stimulates renin-angiotensin system (RAS) resulting in increased aldosterone, increased distal Na reabsorption, and excretion of H^{+} and K^{+}.K depletion stimulates renal ammoniagenesis and inhibits shift of H^{+} out of the cell.Respiratory response: decrease rate and tidal volume.Renal response: decrease in absorption of filtered HCO_{3}^{-} and distal net acid excretion.Therapy: remove inciting condition, restore ECV, correct low K^{+} and Cl^{-}.Prolonged pH >7.6 may increase risk of sensorineural deafness. Neonatal respiratory alkalosis:Results from increased excretion of CO_{2}. Typically secondary to fever or iatrogenic hyperventilation.Rare cause: urea cycle defect--increased NH_{4}^{+} may stimulate central respiratory center.

### PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERNONISM (PHA)

### Basic Information

Kidney is unresponsive to aldosterone.Autosomal dominant (AD) form = mutation in aldosterone receptor.Autosomal recessive (AR) form = mutation in subunit of epithelial Na channel (ENaC).

### Clinical Presentation

Polyuria, dehydration, vomiting, FTT.AR type is systemic, more severe, and lifelong (renal, sweat glands, salivary glands, nasal mucosa, lung, colon involved).Respiratory symptoms (cough, wheezing, tachypnea) from impaired mucociliary clearance; may mimic cystic fibrosis.Eczema/skin lesions.AD type is renal limited and symptoms usually resolve by age 2.Secondary or transient forms:Medications:Amiloride, triamterene, trimethoprim, pentamidine: block ENaCSpironolactone: mineralocorticoid antagonistCyclosporine, ACE inhibitor, NSAIDs, β-blockersUTIs and obstructive uropathy.Rare: medullary necrosis and renal vein thrombosis.

### Diagnosis/Evaluation

Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis with high renin and aldosterone levels.High urine Na.AR form has high sweat and salivary NaCl.Genetic testing available.

### Treatment

Salt supplements, may require up to 10--15 mEq/kg/day.K restriction, K binder (Kayexalate), alkali (Bicitra or NaHCO_{3}^{-}) may be required, especially for AR form.

### BARTTER SYNDROME

### Basic Information

Results from autosomal recessive defects in Na, K, or Cl tubular transport proteins.Multiple types (Table 27.4) classified by which transport protein is defective:Type 1: Na-K-2Cl channel.Type II: ROMK.Type III: CLC-Kb (basolateral Cl channel).Type IVa: barttin, a subunit of basolateral Cl channel.Type IVb: CLC-Kb and CLC-Ka.

### Clinical Presentation

Neonatal and infant forms present with FTT.Types I, II, and IV have severe polyhydramnios resulting in preterm delivery and continued significant polyuria.Type IV presents with deafness.Type III usually presents later in infancy.

### Diagnosis/Evaluation

All forms have hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.Type II will have an initial transient hyperkalemia before developing hypokalemia.Hypomagnesemia can be seen in type III and IV.Genetic testing available.

### Treatment

Indomethacin helpful except in type IV (for unknown reason).Na and water supplementation for all.Potassium and magnesium supplements may be required.

### RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS

All forms characterized by normal AG metabolic acidosis in absence of GI loss of NaHCO_{3}^{-} or cysteine Cl supplementation in TPN.Results from either inadequate renal acidification or renal bicarbonate wasting.

Table 27.4 Subtypes of Bartter Syndrome
[tbl-1.html](tbl-1.html)

aAll forms have hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

## PROXIMAL RTA/TYPE II

### Basic Information

- Impaired capacity to reabsorb HCO₃⁻ by proximal tubule.
- Reabsorption does not occur until serum HCO₃⁻ falls below tubular threshold.
- Ability to secrete H⁺ distally is intact so can maximally acidify urine when serum HCO₃⁻ is below threshold.
- Isolated form is rare, usually part of generalized proximal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome).
- Genetic causes exist.
- AR defect in Na-HCO₃⁻ cotransporter: associated with eye problems.
- Rare AD form without identified gene thus far.

### Clinical Presentation

- FTT, polyuria.

### Diagnosis/Evaluation

- Urine pH variable:
- If serum HCO₃⁻ is below the tubular threshold, urine pH will be maximally acidified (&lt;5.5).
- If treated to raise serum HCO₃⁻ above threshold, urine pH will be high.
- If present with Fanconi syndrome, will also have phosphate wasting, renal glucosuria, aminoaciduria, tubular proteinuria.

### Treatment

- Administer alkali: typically requires 5–10 mEq/kg/d or more.
- If part of generalized proximal dysfunction, will need supplements of affected electrolytes.

## DISTAL RTA/TYPE I

### Basic Information

- Inability to properly acidify the urine.
- In children usually an isolated entity.
- Genetic causes:
- AD or AR mutation in Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger (AE1)
- AR mutation in B1 subunit of H⁺ ATPase; associated with early onset deafness

- AR mutation in A4 subunit of H⁺ ATPase; variably associated with later onset deafness
- Drugs: classically amphotericin.
- Congenital lesions causing tubular dysfunction such as obstructive lesions.

### Clinical Presentation

- FTT, lethargy, polyuria, vomiting, dehydration.
- May have kidney stones or nephrocalcinosis.

### Diagnosis/Evaluation

- Urine pH &lt; 5.5 rules out.
- Urine pH &gt; 6.5 with non-AG metabolic acidosis is suggestive.
- Typically diagnosed by positive urine AG but this is not reliable in neonates due to their high urine anions.
- Can use urine pCO₂–blood pCO₂ gradient:
- Administer alkali to raise serum HCO₃⁻ to slightly above normal.
- Measure pCO₂ from urine and blood.
- Difference should be &gt;20 with normal function.
- Hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, hypokalemia typical.

### Treatment

- Alkali: amount required decreases with age; typically requires less than proximal RTA (2–3 mEq/kg/d).

## HYPERKALEMIA RTA/TYPE IV

### Basic Information

- Impaired potassium and hydrogen secretion in collecting duct.
- Rare in children.
- May be from drugs that impair release or action of aldosterone.
- Also seen in genetic conditions that result in decreased production (CAH) or resistance to aldosterone (PHA type 1).

### Clinical Presentation

- Acidosis typically less severe than other forms: bicarb in high teens.
- Hyperkalemia.

Table 27.5 Normal Values for Renal Indices in Neonate

[tbl-2.html](tbl-2.html)

From Martin RJ. Fanaroff and Martin's Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine. 10th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier/Saunders; 2015 [p. 1680, Table 101.3].

## Diagnosis/Evaluation

- Hyperkalemia.
- High urine sodium.
- Low urine potassium.

## Treatment

- If due to low aldosterone production, mineralocorticoid replacement.
- Low potassium intake.
- Potassium binding resins.
- Alkali.

## MIXED RTA/TYPE III

### Basic Information

- Defect in both proximal and distal tubule.
- Common in VLBW infants in first few weeks.
- Genetic form results from defect in carbonic anhydrase II: presents with mixed RTA and osteopetrosis, growth restriction, mental retardation, cerebral calcifications.

## HORMONAL CONTROL OF RENAL FUNCTION

### Renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

- Angiotensinogen is produced in liver.
- Renin produced by juxtaglomerular apparatus of afferent arterioles converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (ang I).
- Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts ang I to angiotensin II (ang II)
- Ang II via its AT1 receptor subtype constricts efferent arteriole &gt; afferent resulting in increase in GFR.
- Ang II also promotes Na, HCO₃⁻, and water reabsorption along nephron.
- Ang II via AT2 receptor subtype important in nephrogenesis.
- Pharmacologic RAS inhibition during pregnancy or mutation in genes involved in RAS can result in hypotension, hypocalvaria, IUGR, pulmonary hypoplasia, oligohydramnios, anuria, and fetal/neonatal death.

### Prostaglandins:

- Synthesized in kidney via cyclooxygenase pathway.
- Important in maintaining GFR when renal perfusion is low or vasoconstrictive state activated.
- Exposure to NSAIDs in utero results in transient decrease in GFR.
- Use of indomethacin for PDA therapy associated with decrease in GFR and AKI.

### Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP):

- Released from atrial myocytes when stretched.
- Causes afferent arteriole vasodilation and efferent arteriole constriction: increase GFR.
- Inhibits renin production, and aldosterone release stimulates natriuresis.

### Nitric oxide (NO): potent vasodilator synthesized by endothelial cells.

### Dopamine:

- Increases renal blood flow and GFR.
- Inhibits Na reabsorption by inhibiting Na-K ATPase.

### Sympathetic nervous system:

- Low level activation results in equal constriction of afferent and efferent arterioles: decrease renal blood flow with no effect on GFR.
- Higher degree of activation results in constriction of mesangial cells and decreases GFR.
- Stimulates renin release: activates RAS.

## EVALUATION OF RENAL FUNCTION

- See Table 27.5 for normal values of renal indices for term and preterm infants.
- Creatinine most commonly used to assess renal function. Falls to 0.4 mg/dL by 2 weeks after term birth. Preterm infants may have a rise in creatinine over several days then slow fall to 0.4 mg/dL over next month.

### Creatinine clearance:

- GFR = (U_Cr × Urine volume in L) / S_Cr = X L/day
- Requires 24-hour urine collection.
- Provides estimate of GFR but since creatinine secreted by tubules may overestimate; also, immature tubules reabsorb creatinine thus further complicating interpretation of the result.

- Cystatin C has been proposed as alternate estimate of GFR but is not nearly as widely available as serum creatinine measurements.

### Urinalysis:

- Proteinuria: best assessed by spot urine protein/creatinine ratios. Preterm normal &lt; 0.7 mg/mg, term &lt; 0.5 mg/mg. May be seen with ATN, fever, dehydration, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome.
- Hematuria: &gt;5 RBC/hpf by microscopic exam. May be seen with ATN, renal vein thrombosis, urine infection, trauma from catheter.

- FENa = (U_Na (Urine sodium) × S_Cr (Serum creatinine)) / (S_Na (Serum sodium) × U_Cr (Urine creatinine))
- Calculated serum osmolality: (2 × S_Na in mmol/L) + (glucose in mg/dL/18) + (BUN in mg/dL/2.8)

Abnormal Renal Development

ERIN RADEMACHER

# Prenatal Ultrasound (U/S) of Kidneys and the Bladder

- Should evaluate kidney size, shape, echogenicity; amniotic fluid volume; bladder size/shape. See Box 28.1 for potential etiologies of different U/S findings.
- Fetal kidneys can be visualized at 9–12 weeks; Average length: 1 cm at 12 weeks and 2.7 cm at 20 weeks; the bladder can be seen by the 15th week
- Abnormal findings in renal/urinary system account for 20%–30% of anomalies detected on prenatal ultrasound.
- Risk of renal tract malformations is increased by maternal diabetes mellitus and certain drug exposures. Cocaine and alcohol have also been reported to increase risk.

# Prenatal Diagnosis: Hydronephrosis

- Hydronephrosis is defined as significant dilatation of upper tract involving dilatation of the calyces.
- Pelviectasis or pyelectasis usually refers to dilatation of the renal pelvis only.
- Hydronephrosis or pelviectasis seen in ~1%–5% of pregnancies
- Definition depends on which classification system used
- Measurement of the anterior-posterior diameter of the renal pelvis most common
- &gt; 4 mm if &lt; 33 weeks, or &gt; 7 mm at &gt; 33 weeks predictive of postnatal problems
- &gt; 15 mm is highly predictive of ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction
- Presence of oligohydramnios is predictive of long-term renal impairment. Other predictors: lack of reniform shape of kidney, presence of cysts, and increased echogenicity
- 50%–70% of prenatally detected hydronephrosis cases are physiologic/idiopathic (no obstruction or reflux); most resolve over the first 2 years of life
- Other causes of prenatal hydronephrosis:
- Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction: 10%–30%
- Most common cause of severe hydronephrosis
- More common in males
- May be part of syndrome
- Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR): 10%–40%
- Caused by ectopic insertion of the ureter resulting in shortened intravesicular segment
- One-third have affected first-degree relative
- Ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction: 5%–15%
- Usually isolated
- Hydroureter seen on U/S
- Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK): 2%–5%
- Posterior urethral valve (PUV): 1%–5%

- Ureterocele: 1%–3%
- Usually from duplex collection system upper pole ureter
- Eagle-Barrett syndrome, aka “prune belly syndrome”: &lt;1%

# POSTNATAL EVALUATION OF PRENATAL HYDRONEPHROSIS

- U/S in first 1–2 days of life indicated for severe prenatal hydronephrosis, bilateral hydronephrosis, oligohydramnios, concern of bladder obstruction
- If initial early U/S is normal, follow-up in 1–2 weeks when urine output is well established
- Unilateral hydronephrosis: U/S at ~2 weeks of life
- Follow-up U/S done 4–6 weeks of life
- If U/S at 1–2 weeks and 4–6 weeks are both normal, no further follow-up needed
- If severe hydronephrosis present on postnatal U/S, baby should be placed on antibiotic prophylaxis and VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram) obtained

# Prenatal Treatment of Suspected Bladder Outlet Obstruction With Oligohydramnios

- Controversial: intervention has not been shown to reliably improve renal or pulmonary function
- Most common intervention is a vesicoamniotic shunt placed in second trimester in fetus thought to have preserved renal function
- Fetal renal function assessed by fetal urine indices on serial bladder taps (need to empty the bladder to obtain fresh urine for analysis)
- Findings thought to predict good renal function
- Urine Na &lt; 100 mEq/L
- Urine Ca &lt; 8 mg/dL
- Urine Osm &lt; 200 mOsm/L
- Urine β₂ microglobulin &lt; 4 mg/L
- Urine protein &lt; 40 mg/dL

# Oligohydramnios Sequence (Potter Syndrome) (Fig. 28.1)

- Seen in babies with oligohydramnios or anhydramnios of any cause
- Characteristic facies: wide-set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, beaked nose, receding chin, posteriorly rotated and low-set ears

- One-third have abnormal contralateral kidney (agenesis, dysplasia, VUR, ectopia)
- Should have VCUG if contralateral kidney or bladder has abnormal U/S appearance or if cryptorchidism present
- If opposite kidney is normal, should see compensatory hypertrophy

# Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney (ARPKD)

- 1/40,000 incidence
- Autosomal recessive: mutation in PKHD1 gene. Genetic testing available but only detects 85% of cases. Expression is variable within a family
- Prenatal U/S shows enlarged, echogenic kidneys; cysts are usually too small to be detected
- May develop oligohydramnios in second trimester
- After birth may have respiratory failure secondary to oligohydramnios and/or abdominal distention from large kidneys
- May have severe hypertension
- Hyponatremia is common
- Nutrition may be compromised by large kidneys limiting intake
- 70% survive neonatal period, 80% of these will survive to age 10
- 50% develop renal failure in first decade

# Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)

- 1/1000 live births carry mutation but rarely manifests clinically until adulthood
- May have visible cysts at birth

# Renal Artery Thrombosis

- Major risk factor: presence of umbilical artery catheter (UAC)
- Presumed cause is endothelial injury after insertion of UAC
- High UAC (T6–T10) has decreased incidence
- Heparinized fluid also associated with decreased incidence
- Other risk factors: shock, coagulopathy, congestive heart failure
- Incidence varies with modality used to detect:
- U/S with Doppler: 14%–35%
- Angiography: 64%
- Autopsy: 9%–28%
- Symptomatic in 1%–3%
- Presents within first few days in term infant but delayed in preterm (~8 days)
- Signs (Box 28.2)
- Minor clot: mildly decreased lower extremity perfusion, hypertension, hematuria
- Moderate clot: decrease lower extremity perfusion, hypertension, oliguria, congestive heart failure
- Major clot: multi-organ failure
- Prognosis
- 9%–20% mortality with clot involving both aorta and renal artery
- Renovascular hypertension most common long-term complication but often resolves
- Chronic kidney disease not common but always present if clot affected both renal arteries
- Diagnosis
- Thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, increase fibrin split products, variable prothrombin and thromboplastic times, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, increased BUN and creatinine, hematuria
- Diagnostic imaging: Doppler U/S or angiography
- Treatment
- Asymptomatic/minor symptoms: removal of UAC and supportive care
- More severe symptoms: systemic heparinization
- Life-threatening: thrombolytic agents have been used but few data on dosing, safety, or efficacy

# Renal Vein Thrombosis

- Most common blood clot in infancy: reported incidence has varied from 2.2/100,000 live births (symptomatic clot) to 0.5/1000 NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) admissions;
- More common in males (2/3)
- Left renal vein more common than right (60%)
- Unilateral in 70%
- IVC (inferior vena cava) involved in 40%
- Adrenal hemorrhage in 15%
- Risk factors (Box 28.3)
- Prothrombotic factors play significant role
- Maternal diabetes
- Most do not involve an umbilical venous catheter
- Clinical presentation
- Classic triad: gross hematuria, decreased platelets, flank/ abdominal mass (all three seen in only 13%–22% cases)
- Decreased urine output
- Prognosis
- Scarring and atrophy of affected kidney common
- 20% have hypertension
- Mortality ~3%, usually relating to underlying cause of the renal vein thrombosis (RVT)
- Diagnosis and evaluation
- Labs: low platelets, hemolytic anemia, metabolic acidosis, increased BUN/Cr, variable prothrombin and partial thromboplastic times
- Renal ultrasound with Dopplers: appearance of U/S changes with time (Box 28.4), Clot in small intrarenal veins can cause increased resistance in renal artery
- Angiography and MRI are used in selected circumstances

# Box 28.3 Risk Factors for Renal Vein Thrombosis

## Inherited
- Lupus anticoagulant
- Protein C and protein S deficiency
- Plasma antithrombin III activity
- Elevated lipoprotein (a)
- Factor V Leiden mutation
- Prothrombin gene mutation

## Treatment
- Correct any fluid, electrolyte, or acid-base issues in all cases
- Avoid hypertonic solutions, nephrotoxins, hyperosmotic radiocontrast material, diuretics
- Unclear if heparinization leads to differences in long-term outcomes but usually recommended in unilateral cases with IVC involvement
- Fibrinolysis only considered in bilateral cases

# Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

- Can be defined as sudden decline in GFR or tubular function
- Currently used neonatal AKI definition defines AKI into stages based on rise in creatinine or drop in urine output (Table 28.1)

# Box 28.4 Ultrasound Changes in Kidney Affected by Renal Vein Thrombosis

## Early (first week)
- Globular enlargement of kidney
- Increase in echogenicity
- Loss of corticomedullary boundary

Problems with creatinine-based definitions in neonates: creatinine may not change until 25%--50% GFR lost. Creatinine may rise in preterm over the first few days of life, then plateau for several days before fallingMost neonatal AKI does not involve oliguriaRates of AKI in NICU vary with population studiedVery low birthweight: 18%--40%Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): as high as 70%Cooling protocol for HIE (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy): 40%Often divided into prerenal, intrinsic, postrenal causes (Box 28.5)Prenenal AKIMost common type in NICUResults from short period of decreased perfusion of the kidneysTypically reversibleIf intact tubular function, increased reabsorption of sodium and ureaFENa < 1%FEUrea < 35%BUN/Cr ratio increasedInterpretation of above tests can be difficult in preterm, salt-wasting states, or chronic kidney diseaseTreatment: address underlying cause of poor blood flow to kidneys, fluid boluses, colloid such as blood productsIntrinsic AKIPrenenal AKI can progress to ischemic AKI if prolonged hypoperfusion to the kidneys results in cellular damage. Severity ranges from mild tubular dysfunction to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) to renal infarction to corticomedullary necrosis

### Causes of Acute Kidney Injury in the Neonate

PrenenalVolume depletionHypotensionHemorrhageSepsisNecrotizing enterocolitisCongestive heart failureDrugs: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, indomethacin, ibuprofen, amphotericinRenalAcute tubular necrosisRenal dysplasiaPolycystic kidney diseaseRenal venous thrombosisUric acid nephropathyTransient acute renal insufficiency of the newbornPostrenalPosterior urethral valvesBilateral ureteropelvic junction obstructionBilateral ureterovesical junction obstructionNeurogenic bladderObstructive nephrolithiasisNephrotoxic AKI results from drugs or endogenous substancesAminoglycosides, cephalosporins, amphotericin B, rifampin, vancomycin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), IV contrast, myoglobin, hemoglobin all cause direct tubular injuryAcyclovir, uric acid: cause tubular obstructionObstructive AKIResults from congenital malformation, neurogenic bladder, extrinsic compression, fungal ball, stoneEvaluation of AKIHistory: maternal medical history/drug exposures, birth history, coexistent conditions (cardiac or liver issues, sepsis, NEC, etc.), intake, output, weights, BP, drug exposuresExam: assessment of fluid status (hypovolemic, euvolemic, hypervolemic), vital signs, fontanelle, skin turgor, mucus membranes, edema, crackles, murmurs/ rubs, color, capillary refillLabs: electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, albumin, U/A (urinalysis), urinary electrolytesDiagnostic imaging: renal/bladder U/S, CXR (chest x-ray)Treatment of AKIRemove inciting factors if possible: restore perfusion via bolus, pressors if needed to support blood pressure, remove nephrotoxic drugsSpecific therapy for AKI limited:Theophylline may have protective effect as it was shown to decrease AKI rates in asphyxiated infants in one small study“Renal dose dopamine” has not shown decreased rates of AKI in metaanalysisManage consequences of AKI (impaired homeostasis)Hyperkalemia (refer to Table 27.3 in Chapter 27):Remove sources of potassium (TPN, feeds, medications such as potassium-sparing diuretic)Correct hypovolemia if present with normal saline to deliver Na to distal nephron to aid in potassium secretionStabilize myocardium (calcium)Shift into cells (insulin, sodium bicarbonate, albuterol)Remove from body: Lasix, binding resin (Kayexalate), dialysisMetabolic acidosisNaHCO_{3} bolus, repeated dosing may make hypernatremicUse acetate in TPNHypocalcemia: repleteHyperphosphatemia: decrease intake: remove from TPN, use low phosphorus formulas, use phosphate binders with feedsHypermagnesemia: limit intakeFluid statusNeeds to be tailored to individual patient needsFluid-overloaded patient: restrict intake to be less than output; careful use of diuretics may help with volume overload but will not hasten recovery from AKI; for severe overload, may need dialysis for fluid removalEurolemic: keep intake = output + insensible losses

Hypovolemic: use boluses or increased total daily fluids to restore normal blood volumePostobstructive AKI may have polyuria when obstruction relieved

Dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis (PD): instillation of dialysate through catheter placed through abdominal wall into the peritoneal space

Advantages

Insertion of PD catheter may be easier than obtaining vascular access for hemodialysis (HD) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)Can be done by NICU nursesNo anticoagulation neededFor infants who will be expected to need a renal transplant, involves less blood exposure

DisadvantagesLess efficient than HD or CRRT: not ideal for intoxications, tumor lysis, or severe hyperkalemiaContraindicated in abdominal wall defects, ventriculoperitoneal shunts, presence of abdominal adhesionsPeritonitis possible complicationMay lose immunoglobulins into dialysate

Hemodialysis (HD)

Advantage: rapid clearance of solutesDisadvantages:Technically challenging, requires dialysis nursing supportRequires reliable vascular access: minimum 7Fr dual lumen or two 5Fr single lumen cathetersRapid volume shiftsAnticoagulation

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)

Advantages:Able to be used in hemodynamically unstable patientsAllows fluid removal to be adjusted hourlyCan be hooked into ECMO circuitDisadvantagesRequires reliable vascular accessRequires skilled nursing personnelAnticoagulation

## Diuretics

Loop diuretics (furosemide and bumetanide)

Highly protein bound so must be secreted into tubular lumen where they act on thick ascending limb of loop of Henle's Na-K-2Cl transporterHalf-life is much longer in preterm compared to term infantsWith repeated doses, develop tolerance to its effect likely due to compensatory increase in Na reabsorption in other parts of the nephronAdverse effects: hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, decreased bone density, deafnessThiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, metolazone)Secreted into lumen then binds the Na-Cl cotransporter in the distal tubuleLess potent than loop diuretics but can be added to loop diuretic; particularly useful when desire increased diuretic effect and tolerance to loop has developedAdverse effects: hypokalemia, hyponatremiaUnlike loop diuretic, lead to increased calcium reabsorptionAldosterone receptor antagonist (spironolactone)Weak diureticPrimary use in neonate is as potassium-sparing agent in combination with thiazideOther diuretics not commonly used in the NICU

Mannitol: osmotic diureticCarbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide): mild diuretic acting on proximal tubuleAmiloride: blocks epithelial sodium channel in collecting duct; potassium sparing diuretic
