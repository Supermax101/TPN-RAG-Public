# Chapter 1 ANTHROPOMETRICS

## Anthropometrics – General Information

- Anthropometrics are measurements of the human body, such as height, weight, head circumference, body mass index, muscle mass, and body fat
- In children, these measurements help to assess for adequate growth and nutritional intake
- Appropriate growth can be determined in several ways, including the comparison of individual growth parameters to reference standards, such as growth charts
- Assessing growth trends at routine intervals throughout infancy and childhood is recommended
- A nutrition consult with a registered dietitian is recommended when there are growth concerns

## Anthropometrics – Growth Charts

### General Information

- A series of percentile curves that show the distribution of one or more of the following:
- Head circumference/frontal occipital circumference (FOC) for age
- Weight for age
- Height for age
- Weight-for-length
- Body mass index (BMI) for age
- Used for children from birth to 20 years old
- There are separate growth charts for boys and girls
- Intended as a measurement tool to help determine if growth is adequate
- Not intended as a sole diagnostic instrument

### Standard Growth Charts

- Growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are recommended
- Children 0-2 years old – WHO growth charts
- Children 2-20 years old – CDC growth charts
- Premature Infants born &lt;37 weeks – Fenton growth chart is the practice standard
- Refer to the end of the chapter for these growth charts

### Other Growth Charts

- Other growth charts exist for a variety of diagnoses, including Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, sickle cell disease, and prematurity (non-Fenton)
- These growth charts are not recommended to be used as standard measurement tool and proper interpretation is needed
- Instead, it is recommended to follow growth trends on the appropriate standard charts

# Anthropometrics - Growth Chart Assessment

## Head Circumference/Frontal Occipital Circumference (FOC)
- Measurement reflects brain growth
- Generally measured in children ages birth to 3 years

## Weight
- Infants
- 10-15% of birth weight during the first week of life (may be higher in premature infants)
- Most infants regain birth weight by 10 to 14 days of life
- Adolescence
- Weight gain velocities are increased
- Refer to table 1.1 for expected weight gain

## Height
- Adolescence
- Height gain velocities are increased
- Refer to table 1.1 for expected height gain

## Weight-for-Length and Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Measure of adiposity indirectly through the relationship of height and weight
- Children 0-2 years old
- Weight-for-length percentiles are recommended
- Weight-for-length &lt;2nd percentile is associated with underweight
- Weight-for-length &gt;98th percentile is associated with overweight
- Children 2-20 years old
- BMI percentiles are recommended
- BMI &lt;5th percentile is associated with underweight
- BMI &gt;85th percentile is associated with overweight
- Calculating BMI:
- Option 1: weight (kg) ÷ height (m²)
- Option 2: weight (kg) ÷ height (cm) ÷ height (cm) x 10,000
- Option 3: weight (lbs) ÷ height (in) ÷ height (in) x 703
- Note: If the height is abnormally high or low or if there is increased muscle mass (i.e. an athlete, stunting conditions, spinal conditions, amputations) BMI may not be the ideal way to calculate underweight or overweight
- Refer to table 1.2

# Anthropometrics - Additional Information

## Segmental Weights
- Used to assess ideal body weight of people with amputations
- Percentages based on adult population
- Refer to table 1.3

---

<!-- Page 9 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

- Ideal Body Weight (IBW)
- The weight for a specific age or height that is optimal for nutrition status
- Although there are several methods available for calculating IBW, the BMI method is the only method that can be applied consistently to all children (ages 2-20 years old) and to adults
- Determining the IBW
- Children 0-2 years old
- Using the WHO weight-for-length growth chart, plot the length at the 50th percentile, the associated weight = IBW
- Children 2-20 years old
- Using the CDC BMI for age growth chart and the child's age, plot the BMI at the 50th percentile and then multiple that BMI by the child's Height in m² = IBW

- Alternative Methods of Determining Height
- If unable to obtain accurate heights, consider using alternative methods
- Refer to table 1.4

- Measures of Body Muscle and Fat
- Used to estimate body fat and muscle stores
- Measurements can be trended over time
- Measurements are compared to reference standards
- With other anthropometrics, can be used as additional information, especially when weight or height may be difficult to determine (i.e. edema, ascites, contractures)
- Accurate measurements require precisely calibrated equipment and trained users
- Reference data can be obtained from various reliable sources, including www.peditools.org
- Measurement Options:
- Triceps Skinfold (TSF)
- Mid-arm Circumference (MAC)
- Mid-arm Muscle Circumference (MAMC)
- Calculation: MAMC (mm) = MAC (mm) - [3.14 x TSF (mm)]

# Chapter 2 NUTRITIONAL NEEDS

## Nutritional Needs - General Information

- This chapter contains information to determine nutrient needs, including for energy, macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat, protein), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals), fiber and water
- Note: where specifically indicated, information has been extrapolated for ease of application

## Nutritional Needs - Daily Reference Intake (DRI) Information

- The National Academy of Sciences and Health Canada collaborated to establish the DRIs
- DRI is a generic term used to refer to the reference values for a variety of macro and micronutrients
- Reference values are for normal, apparently healthy individuals eating a typical North American diet
- Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR)-a range of nutrition intake that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intakes of essential nutrients
- Adequate Intake (AI)-the recommended average daily intake level based on observed or experimentally determined approximations or estimates of nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people that are assumed to be adequate; used when the RDA cannot be determined
- Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)-the average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirements of half the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group
- Estimated Energy Requirement (EER)-the average dietary energy intake that is predicted to maintain energy balance in a healthy person consistent with good health; in children, the EER is taken to include the needs associated with the deposition of tissues at rates consistent with good health
- Physical Activity Level (PAL)-het ratio of total energy expenditure to basal energy expenditure
- Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)-the average daily dietary nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97-98%) healthy individuals
- Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)-the highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population; as intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase
- Not Determined (ND)-lack of suitable data

# Nutritional Needs - DRI Energy

## General

- Use the energy DRI to estimate the energy needs for healthy individuals
- Energy needs may be altered in critically ill or stressed individuals and should be adjusted up or down as clinically indicated
- Consult a dietitian for assistance assessing an individual's nutritional needs
- EER equations should be used over average EER when child is not close to the average reference weight for age group
- Refer to tables 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4

## Overweight

- Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) for overweight children ≥3 years old and adults is for weight maintenance; if weight loss is desired, the TEE will need to be adjusted
- Refer to table 2.5

## PAL

- For ≥3 years old, the following PAL should be for the PA coefficients in the EER and TEE equations
- Sedentary: typical activities of daily living (ADLs) (i.e. household tasks, walking to bus)
- Low Active: typical ADLs PLUS 30-60 minutes of daily moderate activity (i.e. walking at 3-4 miles/hour or 5-7 kilometers/hour)
- Active: typical ADLs PLUS at least 60 minutes of daily moderate activity
- Very Active: typical ADLs PLUS at least 60 minutes of daily moderate activity PLUS an additional 60 minutes of vigorous activity or 120 minutes of moderate activity

## Nutritional Needs - Energy Stress Factors

- Do not use these factors when calculating the energy DRI and TEE
- Total energy needs = REE (from predictive energy equation) x stress factor
- Refer to table 2.6

Table 2.6 Energy Stress Factors

[tbl-10.html](tbl-10.html)

## Nutritional Needs - Other Energy Equations

- The following are alternatives to the DRI for calculating energy needs
- Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Resting Energy Expenditure (REE), and Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) are all used under the assumption that the individual is free of pathology and fever that affect energy expenditure
- Applying BMR, REE, and RMR to the patient requires an additional stress factor and activity factor
- Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) does not require a stress or activity factor

## Nutritional Needs - Fiber

### DRI Fiber
- Total fiber is defined as dietary fiber + functional fiber (i.e. fructooligosaccharides and inulin)
- The typical US diet contains -5.1 g of functional fibers/day
- DRI is based on 14 g total fiber/1000 kcals
- Refer to table 2.28

### Other Fiber
- General
- Starting with a large dose of fiber may result in diarrhea or constipation (particularly when not enough fluids are given)
- There are exceptions where higher amounts are appropriate, including for children with short bowel syndrome
- Infants
- Do not add fiber to formula before consultation with a specialist
- Infants with abnormal bowel movements may need a referral to gastroenterology
- For ages 6-12 months, gradually introduce whole grain cereals, green vegetables, and legumes so that fiber intake is about 5 g/day by 1 year old

# Chapter 3 LACTATION

## Lactation - General Information

- Breast milk is the gold standard for infant feeding
- Breast milk is superior in nutritional content, supports gastrointestinal function, provides host defense and has maternal benefits
- Exclusive breast feeding is recommended until about 6 months of age and continued breastfeeding for 12 months of age
- Breastfeeding beyond 1 year and up to 2 years of age has continued benefits
- Infants receiving breast milk should receive 400 units/day vitamin D from a supplement
- Refer to table 3.1 for breast milk storage and usage guidelines

## Lactation - Common Breastfeeding Concerns

### Increasing Milk Supply

- Pump 8-10 times in a 24-hour period
- For older infants, pump according to home feeding schedule
- Pump for 10-15 minutes or at least 1-2 minutes after milk flow has stopped
- Put baby directly to breast rather than pumping, if possible
- Massage breasts before and during pumping or feeding
- Encourage mother to take care of herself (rest, diet, adequate fluids)
- Promote milk ejection reflex through relaxation techniques, thinking of baby, or pumping immediately after visiting the baby
- Provide emotional support to mother
- Encourage Kangaroo Care as often as possible
- Consider a galactagogue when above methods have not been successful (consult obstetrician)

### Sore Nipples

- Nurse on the least sore breast first
- Increase the frequency of feedings
- Maintain correct positioning and latch
- Alternate nursing positions
- Assure moms that tenderness peaks on day 3-5 and will subside by day 7-10
- Avoid non-nutritive sucking (short quick suck like a pacifier)
- Do not allow infant to sleep at the breast
- Break suction correctly by putting index finger in baby's mouth towards cheek
- Apply mother's milk to nipple and air dry
- Keep nipples dry with breast pads or shells
- Lanolin cream may be applied to nipples after breastfeeding/pumping and does not need to be washed off prior to breastfeeding or pumping

---

<!-- Page 43 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

## Engorgement

- Breast feed your baby 8-12 times per day to prevent engorgement
- Avoid early use of bottles and pacifiers while baby is learning to breast feed
- Use a pump to express breast milk if a feeding is missed or unable to latch
- Apply moist, warm towels to breast for 2-5 minutes or take a warm shower before nursing or pumping
- Gently massage breast before and during breastfeeding
- If breasts are severely swollen, apply icy cold compressions after nursing/pumping for comfort
- If nipples are engorged, use gentle hand expression to express some milk to soften the breast
- For severe engorgement cabbage leaves may be wrapped around breasts for 5-10 minutes, 1-4 times per day (overuse may dry up milk supply)

## Lactation - Infants at Risk for Inadequate Breast Milk Intake

- Premature birth or small for gestational age
- Poor muscle tone/suck
- Unusual mouth conformations, (short frenulum, high palate, cleft lip/palate)
- Mothers with large nipples (larger in diameter than a quarter)
- Previous breast surgery involving an incision around the nipple or areola
- Widely spaced breasts that are long and thin, that did not get larger in pregnancy, or that differ in size
- Maternal history of diabetes, hypothyroidism or polycystic ovary syndrome

## Lactation - Signs the Baby is Getting Enough Breast Milk with Breastfeeding

- Milk comes in by 2-4 days postpartum
- Baby nurses at least eight times in a 24-hour period
- Baby nurses 10-50 minutes at each feeding and seems content after feedings
- Baby has several periods of swallowing during each feeding
- Breasts feel softer or lighter after the baby has nursed
- Baby has a bowel movement every day, and by day 5 they have turned yellow
- Wet diapers increase by day of life 5-7
- Baby at or above birth weight by day of life 10-14

## Lactation - Kangaroo Care

- Definition: skin-to-skin, is contact between the baby's front and the parent's chest
- Stimulates breast milk production
- Stable infant heart rate, respirations, and temperature
- Sense of security
- Better weight gain and earlier discharge from hospital
- Baby-mother bond
- Improved maternal confidence and breastfeeding duration

# Lactation - Contraindications to Breast Milk

- Galactosemia
- Mothers using illicit drugs or alcohol
- Mothers that are HIV-positive and have high a viral load
- Mothers with breast abscess - until resolved, mom should pump and dump her breast milk to maintain milk supply; baby may breast feed on the unaffected breast
- Mothers with rabies - mom should "pump and dump" her breast milk until she gets her immunoglobulin vaccination series, at which time breast feeding may resume
- Human T-cell lymphotropic virus
- Untreated brucellosis
- Active (infectious) untreated tuberculosis (expressed breast milk may be used)
- Active herpes lesions on breast
- Ebola virus
- Mothers receiving certain types of chemotherapy or radioactive medications
- All maternal medications and supplements should be reviewed with the medical provider
- Smoking should be strongly discouraged and alcohol intake minimal

Table 3.1 Breastmilk-Storage and Usage Guidelines

[tbl-38.html](tbl-38.html)

*Discard any breast milk remaining in used bottle 1 hour after the start of a feeding

# Chapter 4 ORAL NUTRITION

## Oral Nutrition - Breast milk

- Exclusive breast feeding is recommended until about 6 months of age and continued breastfeeding until 12 months of age
- Infants receiving breast milk should receive 400 international units/day vitamin D from a supplement
- Refer to the lactation c for additional information

## Oral Nutrition - Infant Formula

- If inadequate breast milk supply or contraindications, it is recommended to give a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved infant formula until 1 year old
- Use prepared bottles of formula within one hour; discard any formula left in the bottle after feeding
- Infants receiving formula should receive 400 international units/day vitamin D; if inadequate content from formula, a supplement is recommended
- Refer to the formula chapter for additional information

## Oral Nutrition - Solid Foods

- Development is a good indicator of when solid foods can be introduced
- The infant should have head control and be able to sit with help or support
- The infant may push food out of the mouth with the tongue
- The infant moves pureed food forward and backward in mouth with tongue to swallow
- The infant will recognize the food and hold her mouth open as a spoon approaches
- These developmental milestones usually occur between 4-6 months of age

- First foods offered should be good sources of protein, iron, and zinc
- Animal foods (such as meats, organs, fish, and chicken) contain the highest content
- If animal foods are not possible, then consider fortified cereals, beans, and legumes

- Other foods should include a variety of vegetables, fruits, and cereals (from a variety of grains); there is a risk of inorganic arsenic exposure from infant rice cereal, which can affect infant development
- New foods should be offered one at a time, offered over several days, before a new food is offered, to monitor for allergies or intolerance
- Finger foods can be offered once the infant is able to sit up and bring her hands or objects to their mouth
- Any milk not designated for infants (i.e. cow, soy, almond, rice, goat) should not be given before 12 months due to inadequate nutritional values
- Juice should only be offered in a cup and limited to 4 ounces per day for children &gt;6 months old
- Refer to table 4.1 part 1 and part 2 for nutrition guidelines

---

<!-- Page 47 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

# Oral Nutrition - Toddlers

- By one year of age, the child should be eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, eggs, and fish
- Foods offered to a toddler repeatedly (10-15 times) are eventually accepted; this helps avoid development of picky eating styles
- Whole milk should be used from ages 1-2 years unless the infant is at risk for overweight or obesity or there is a family history of obesity, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular disease
- Refer to table 4.1 part 1 and part 2 for nutrition guidelines

# Oral Nutrition - Preschoolers

- Portions should be small and easy to handle
- Self-feeding can enhance sense of independence
- Continue to avoid foods that can cause choking hazards such as grapes, hot dogs, raisins, nuts, gum, popcorn, and hard candies
- For children &gt;2 years old, nutrition guidelines are based on the MyPlate plan and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans

# Oral Nutrition - Children

- For children &gt;2 years old, nutrition guidelines are based on the MyPlate plan and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans

# Oral Nutrition - Adolescents

- Significant growth and development during this time results in increased nutrient needs
- Adolescent food habits include skipping meals, consuming more meals outside the home, consuming energy dense foods and beverages as snacks, consumption of fast food, and dieting
- Inadequate intake of folic acid, vitamins A, D, E, and B6, calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and fiber may be seen during the teenage years
- Iron requirements are high due to rapidly increasing lean body mass and menstrual losses in females
- Teens who follow vegan diets are vulnerable to deficiencies in vitamin D and B12, riboflavin, protein, calcium, iron, and zinc
- Eating disorders and obesity should be screened for in adolescence
- For children &gt;2 years old, nutrition guidelines are based on the MyPlate plan and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans

# Oral Nutrition - Allergens and Hazardous Foods

- Do not give honey before 12 months of age due to the risk of botulism
- There is no reason to delay the introduction of highly allergenic foods (egg, soy, peanut, dairy, tree nut, wheat, fish, and seafood) beyond 4-6 months of age; delaying the introduction may increase the baby's risk of developing allergies
- Peanuts and tree nuts may be offered as butter, not as whole nuts, due to choking hazard
- A quick rule of thumb for serving sizes is 1 tablespoon per year of age
- Avoid foods that are choking hazards, such as grapes, hot dogs, raisins, nuts, gum, popcorn, and hard candies, until after 4 years of age

# Oral Nutrition - My Plate

- MyPlate is a tool based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans to help consumers make better food choices
- MyPlate is designed to remind Americans to eat healthfully; it is not intended to change consumer behavior alone
- MyPlate illustrates the five food groups using a familiar mealtime visual, a place setting

# Oral Nutrition - Dietary Guidelines for Americans

- Shift to healthier food and beverage choices
- Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices
- Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain
- Support healthy eating patterns for all
- Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities
- Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan
- All food and beverage choices matter
- Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy and reduce the risk of chronic disease
- Focus on variety, nutrient density and amount
- To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts
- A variety of vegetable, including dark green, red and orange, legumes, starchy, etc
- Fruits, especially whole fruits
- Grains, at least half of which are whole grains
- Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese and/or fortified soy beverages
- A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds and soy products

- Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake
- Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns
- When sugar is added to foods and beverages to sweeten them, they add calories without contributing essential nutrients
- Consumption of added sugars can make it difficult to meet nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits
- Replacing added sugars with high-intensity sweeteners may reduce calorie intake in the short-term, yet questions remain about their effectiveness as a long-term weight management strategy
- Encourage healthy oils, including vegetable oils and those found in foods such as nuts, seeds, seafood, olives, and avocados
- Limit saturated fats and trans fats, added sugars and sodium
- Consume less than 10% of calories/day from saturated fats
- Consume less than 10% of calories/day from added sugars
- Consume less than 2,300 mg/day of sodium

- Caffeine
- Caffeine is a dietary component that functions in the body as a stimulant
- Most intake of caffeine in the United States comes from coffee, tea, and soda
- Caffeine is a substance that is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in colatype beverages by FDA
- For healthy adults, the FDA has cited 400 mg/day of caffeine as an amount not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects
- Beverages containing caffeine should be avoided for children younger than age 2 years old

Oral Nutrition - Thickened Liquids
- Some children who aspirate thin liquids may require thickened liquids
- Thickeners should not be used in tube feeding
- Consult speech therapy for patient specific recommendations
- Refer to table 4.2

# Oral Nutrition - International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI)

- "The IDDSI framework consists of a continuum of 8 levels (0-7), where drinks are measured from levels 0-4, while foods are measured from levels 3-7"; refer to the picture below
- "The IDDSI framework provides a common terminology to describe food textures and drink thickness"
- Transitional foods "start off as one texture but change into another texture when moisture like water or saliva is added or when a change in temperature occurs (for instance, when a food is heated)"
- Examples include ice cream, ice chips, wafers, Veggie Straws®, and Cheeto® Puffs
- Mixed consistency foods include both solids and liquids, like soups or cereal with milk
- "Other items that appear to be a single consistency on a plate may quickly separate into two consistencies in the mouth (e.g., watermelon)"; these foods are more challenging to swallow with dysphagia
- Clinical evaluation should be assessed before allowing the foods on the diet

# Chapter 5 ENTERAL NUTRITION

## Enteral Nutrition - Indications
- Inadequate oral intake due to various reasons (i.e. developmental, behavioral, anatomical, increased nutrient needs)
- Aspiration risk with oral intake
- Gastrointestinal system is functional
- Can be used for short term or long term nutrition support

## Enteral Nutrition - Contraindications
- Unable to safely place a feeding tube (i.e. mucositis, thrombocytopenia, esophageal injuries)
- Gastrointestinal system is not functional (i.e. ileus, bleeding, pneumatosis, obstruction)
- Hemodynamic instability due to risk of bowel ischemia

## Enteral Nutrition - Site of Delivery
- Gastric
- Preferred route
- Allows for more physiologic bolus feedings
- Easier tube placement
- Can use with bolus or continuous feeds
- Postpyloric
- Use if high risk of aspiration
- Use in gastroparesis or delayed gastric emptying
- Only use with continuous feeds

## Enteral Nutrition - Routes
- Nasoenteric
- Examples: nasogastric (NG), nasoduodenal (ND)
- Can typically be placed at the bedside
- Easier tube placement
- Recommended for short term use
- May contribute to oral feeding aversions
- Semi-permanent
- Examples: gastrostomy tube (G-tube), gastrojejunostomy tube (GJ-tube)
- G-tubes can be placed endoscopically or surgically
- Requires sedation for placement
- When removed will leave a small abdominal scar
- Recommended for long term use

## Enteral Nutrition - Initiation and Advancement
- Individualize EN for age, nutrition status/needs, refeeding syndrome risk, and other issues (medical, gastrointestinal, etc.)
- Determine if patient is appropriate for bolus feeds, if not start continuous feeds
- Initiate a full strength, isotonic, and age/medically appropriate formula

---

<!-- Page 56 -->

- Start at a slow rate and advance as tolerated
- When advancing, make only one change at a time (volume vs concentration)
- Additional free water may be needed for patients &gt;1 year old due to higher
- Monitor for gastrointestinal tolerance (i.e. distention, emesis, diarrhea)
- Refer to table 5.1 for enteral nutrition complications and management
- Refer to tables 5.2 and 5.3 for EN continuous and bolus initiation and advancement
- Not intended for patients with gastrointestinal issues or risk of refeeding

Chapter 6 FORMULA

## Formula - Preparation

- Wash hands and all supplies prior to preparation
- Water used for mixing infant formula must be from a safe water source
- Municipal water is generally safe (i.e. tap water); contact local health department for information
- Well water is not recommended; however, if well water is used, test the water to see if it's safe before using it to mix infant formula
- If there is concern or uncertainty about the safety of the tap water, use bottled water or bring cold tap water to a rolling boil for 1 minute (no longer), then cool the water to room temperature for no more than 30 minutes before using

## Formula - Standard Concentrations

- Follow the manufacturer instructions for standard preparation; measure all ingredients separately, combine into a clean container and mix, cover and refrigerate until use
- Note that some formulas may vary in mixing instructions
- Prepared formulas that are not being used should be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours
- Discard prepared formula 1 hour after start of oral feeding
- Once opened, cans of powdered formula should be used within 4 weeks
- Ready-to-feed formula that has been opened and refrigerated should be used within 48 hours or per label instructions

## Formula - Non-Standard Concentrations

- It is sometimes necessary to modify a formula recipe to increase or decrease its calorie concentration
- Formula mixing recipes for non-standard concentrations should be provided by the registered dietitian or the formula manufacturer

## Breast Milk

- Nutrient composition varies; estimated average standard concentration is 20 kcal/oz
- Gold standard for infant feeding; recommended for the first year of life
- Refer to the lactation chapter for the additional information regarding breast milk

## Formula - Term Infant Formulas

- Standard concentration is 20 kcal/oz; consult a registered dietitian for non-standard concentrations
- Appropriate for full-term infants until 1 year of age
- For use when breast milk is not chosen or not available

- Contains higher concentrations of certain nutrients that are essential to premature infants (such as protein, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, vitamin A)
- Caution: Intake of some nutrients (especially fat-soluble vitamins) may be excessive when these formulas are used in larger infants

## Formula - Premature Post-Discharge Infant Formulas

- Standard concentration is 22 kcal/oz
- Transitional premature formula with nutrients at higher levels than term infant formula (but less than premature infant formulas)
- Used for premature infant with birth weight 1800-2500 g and recommend continue until corrected age of 12 months
- Women Infants and Children (WIC) will provide until 12 months chronological age for infants born premature (&lt;37 weeks) or with birth weight &lt;2500 g (with WIC prescription, per current Texas WIC formulary)

## Formula - Toddler/Follow-up Formulas

- Calorie concentrations vary from 17-24 kcal/oz
- Formula manufacturers generally recommend for use from 9-24 months
- Not nutritionally necessary to switch an older baby to a toddler or follow-up formula; usage is optional
- Formulated to help bridge the nutritional gaps when transitioning to table foods therefore may be used in older infants and toddlers who are eating solid foods
- Higher levels of some nutrients, including calcium (level is similar to that found in whole cow's milk)

- Standard concentration is 30 kcal/oz, but 36 kcal/oz, 45 kcal/oz and 60 kcal/oz versions are available
- For use in children starting at age 10-13 years and adults
- When used in children, need to assess if nutrient needs can be met, as often adult formulas are lower in calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, etc
- Nutritionally balanced, can meet 100% of an adult's nutritional needs
- Some formulas contain fiber
- Usually lactose-free, gluten-free, kosher
- Available for oral use or tube feeding

# Formula - Blended Formulas

- Some formulas are made from blended foods; review ingredients for allergens
- These formulas provide a variety of foods and possible improvements in GI tolerance
- If family desires to make a homemade blenderized formula from foods, consult a registered dietitian
- Review for appropriate tube size (≥14 French), adequate supplies (high power blender), understanding of safe food handling
- Not recommended with GJ tube, delayed gastric emptying, inability to tolerate bolus feed
- Review adequacy of nutrient content in recipes and adjust ingredients/ modulators as needed

# Formula - Lower Calorie/Higher Nutrient Formulas

- Used for patients with low calorie needs
- May help to better meet nutrient needs (i.e. protein, vitamins, minerals)
- Decreases the need for additional nutritional supplements

# Formula - Hydrolyzed, Peptide and Amino Acid Based Formulas

## Infants
- Extensively hydrolyzed protein infant formulas can be used when there is a milk protein allergy or if not tolerating intact proteins in standard infant formulas

## Pediatrics and Adults
- Peptide formulas can be used in intolerance of intact protein formulas, but they are not appropriate for milk protein allergy
- Amino acid formulas can be used if not tolerating a peptide formula, severe gastrointestinal issues, and for milk protein allergy

# Formula - Ketogenic Diet Formulas
- Used with ketogenic diet therapy primarily for seizures
- Consult a registered dietitian prior to use

# Formula - Renal Formulas
- Used if needing decreased mineral content
- Typically used in renal disease
- Refer to the Renal section for more information on renal formulas

# Formula - Metabolic Formulas
- Appropriate for the dietary management of inborn errors of metabolism
- Offending amino acids are eliminated from the product
- Caution—Should only be used under the direct and continuing supervision genetics/ metabolic physician
- May cause harm to patient when used improperly
- Refer to the inborn error of metabolism chapter for more information on specific inborn errors of metabolism and corresponding formula needs

# Formula - Modulars and Additives
- Not for use as sole source of nutrition
- Usually added to formula when higher amounts of a certain nutrients are needed (i.e. carbohydrate, protein, fat, fiber, electrolytes, minerals)
- Consult a registered dietitian prior to use

# Formula - Electrolytes
- Use cautiously and as medically indicated
- Liquid electrolyte solutions that can be added to formula feeds:
- Calcium - calcium carbonate
- Sodium - sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate

# Chapter 7 PARENTERAL NUTRITION (PN)

## PN - Goals

- Short term: deliver nutrients to support physiologic need when oral intake or enteral nutrition (EN) is not feasible or not sufficient to meet total nutrient needs
- Long term: promote growth in patients with PN dependence

## PN - Intravenous Access

### Peripheral

- Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition (PPN) is generally not recommended due to its inability to meet nutritional needs and the high risk of complications and should only be used short term
- If PPN is used, it cannot exceed 900 mOsm/L

### Central

- Preferred access for PN
- Catheter tip terminates in the superior vena cava near the junction of the right atrium
- Central access is required for long term parenteral nutrition, those who are fluid restricted and those who are unable to meet nutrient requirements with osmolality &lt;900 mOsm/kg²

## PN - Contraindications for Use

- Functioning GI tract
- Inability to obtain venous access

## PN - Indications for Use and Timing of Initiation

### Infants

- Begin PN shortly after birth in infants with birth weight &lt;1500 g
- Initiate PN for total or supplemental nutrition if enteral nutrition (EN) is not feasible or unable to meet total nutrient needs

### Children

- Use PN when intestinal tract is not functional, cannot be accessed or when oral/EN is not sufficient to meet nutritional needs
- Initiate PN in 1-3 days in infants and within 4-5 days in older children and adolescents when evident they will not tolerate full oral intake or EN for an extended period of time
- Delay starting PN for 1 week for self-limited illness in infant, child, or adolescent

### Adults

- PN should only be used when EN is not an option
- Initiated PN within 3-5 days in those nutritionally at risk or those unlikely to achieve desired oral intake or EN
- Initiate PN after 7 days in well-nourished adults who have been unable to receive 50% or more of estimated requirements orally or enterally

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook
167

# PN - Initiation Steps

- Assess nutritional status including growth, GI history and nutritional history (including any deficiencies)
- Determine weight to use for calculations (current, usual, drug weight, etc)
- Determine type of intravenous access
- Determine fluid requirements; if fluid restriction indicated, determine the fluid volume available for PN
- Determine macronutrient initial needs and goals, including calorie, protein, fat, and carbohydrates
- Determine duration, typically initiated at 24 hours, and PN and lipid infusion rates

# PN - Weaning

- Once oral/enteral nutrition is advanced, assess nutrition and fluid intake from oral/enteral nutrition
- If appropriate to wean PN, then decrease macronutrients, micronutrients, and/or volume as appropriate
- Discontinue PN once oral/enteral nutrition meets at least 75% of estimated energy need

# PN - Monitoring (Acute care)

[tbl-69.html](tbl-69.html)

*Lab checks may need to be more frequent depending on the status of the patient

---

<!-- Page 171 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

# PN - Fluids

- Fluid intake is generally based on maintenance volume requirement but may be restricted or increased depending on clinical condition, such as cardiovascular, renal, or GI disease
- Weight, intake from all sources, laboratory results, vital signs and physical assessment should be evaluated daily after initiation of PN to assess fluid intake

[tbl-70.html](tbl-70.html)

# PN - Energy

- Indirect calorimetry is the gold standard for determining energy needs
- American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) energy recommendations
- Based on assumption of normal age-related organ function and normal losses so needs should be individualized and adjusted based on growth and clinical status
- May overestimate energy needs in some children
- PN energy needs are typically 10-15% lower than enteral/oral energy needs

# PN - Carbohydrate

- Provides 3.4 kcal/g of dextrose (aka glucose)
- Macronutrient distribution goals: 40-60% of total parenteral energy intake
- Maximum: 10-15% with peripheral access and 30% dextrose with central access
- Goal may differ from recommendations below based on individual needs and glucose tolerance

[tbl-72.html](tbl-72.html)

# PN - Protein

- Provides 4 kcal/g of crystalline amino acids
- Macronutrient distribution goal: 10-20% total parenteral energy intake
- Trophamine® 10%: pediatric amino acid solution, use at minimum until 1 year old
- Plenamine™ 15%: concentrated adult amino acid solution, can be used PRN once &gt;1 year old

Chapter 8 FAILURE TO THRIVE (FTT)

## FTT - General Information

- FTT is a term used to indicate a pattern of growth that is less than expected for age due to lack of sufficient nutrition
- FTT is a vague descriptive term that does not provide a distinct diagnostic direction
- Many authors have proposed that FTT should no longer be used as a diagnostic label and recommend the diagnosis of malnutrition
- There is no consensus on the definition of FTT however the following are often used:
- Nutritional diagnosis of malnutrition (mild, moderate, or severe); refer to the malnutrition chapter for additional information
- Decreased growth velocity where weight, height, or weight for length/BMI falls &gt;2 major percentiles over time (&lt;3 months considered acute, &gt;3 months considered chronic)
- Weight and/or weight for length/Body Mass Intake (BMI) for sex and age (corrected age with prematurity) plotting &lt;2nd percentile (for 0-2 years old on the World Health Organization growth charts) or &lt;5th percentile (for 2-20 years old on the Center for Disease Control growth charts)

## Risk Factors

- Medical, traditionally known as organic causes (i.e. prematurity, cystic fibrosis, heart disease)
- Psychosocial, traditionally known as inorganic causes (i.e. food insecurity, neglect, homelessness, unusual nutrition beliefs)

## Pathophysiology

- Inadequate intake
- Excessive losses
- Increased metabolism
- Impaired nutrient utilization

## FTT - Nutrition History

- Breastfeeding history (frequency, duration, latch, mother's concerns, GI symptoms)
- Bottle feeding history (formula type, mixing, volume, frequency, duration, GI symptoms)
- Type and quantity of food/beverage intake (including food allergies and intolerances, GI symptoms)
- Meal patterns, eating/feeding behaviors
- Past/current medical, social and family history
- Family dynamics, cultural beliefs, financial/maternal resources
- Caregiver’s nutrition knowledge

Chapter 9 MALNUTRITION

## Malnutrition - General Information

- Malnutrition, as defined by the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), is an “imbalance between nutrient requirement and intake, resulting in cumulative deficits of energy, protein or micronutrients that may negatively affect growth, development and other relevant outcomes”
- Marasmus, kwashiorkor, and protein calorie malnutrition are other terms for malnutrition, however diagnosis of kwashiorkor and marasmus is not standard of practice in developed counties
- In the developed world, malnutrition is predominantly related to disease and chronic conditions
- Illness-related malnutrition can be attributed to nutrient loss, increased energy expenditure, decreased nutrient intake, or altered nutrient utilization
- Failure to Thrive (FTT) is often used as a synonym for malnutrition but it is a vague term with many definitions; refer to the FTT chapter for additional information
- Medical nutrition therapy should be based on the underlying cause and severity of malnutrition
- Patients with malnutrition are at increased risk of refeeding syndrome; refer to the refeeding syndrome chapter for additional information

## Malnutrition - Diagnosing

- Malnutrition Severity - mild malnutrition, moderate malnutrition, or severe malnutrition
- Malnutrition Duration
- Acute is &lt;3 months - primarily affect weight
- Chronic is ≥3 months - affects weight and can also affect linear and head circumference growth

Chapter 10 REFEEDING SYNDROME

## Refeeding Syndrome - Pathophysiology

- After extensive periods of nutrient deprivation, the reintroduction of glucose in the blood stream causes an increase in insulin secretion
- This in turn drives phosphorus (Phos) and potassium (K) intracellularly and if inadequate body stores, can cause decreased serum levels of Phos and K
- The mechanism for magnesium (Mg) shifts is not well understood, but low Mg serum levels can be seen
- The decrease in serum electrolytes (including K, Phos, and Mg) may be sudden and severe
- Thiamine demand increases significantly during reintroduction of glucose
- Thiamine is cofactor for glucose dependent metabolic pathways and is needed for the conversion of lactate to pyruvate

## Refeeding Syndrome - Medical Impact

- Phos depletion can lead to:
- Respiratory issues (including muscle dysfunction and in severe cases acute respiratory failure)
- Cardiac issues (including decreased cardiac contractility and arrhythmias)
- Oxygenation issues (including increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity, reduced oxygen released to tissues, and tissue hypoxia)
- K depletion can lead to:
- Respiratory issues (including respiratory depression)
- Cardiac issues (including impaired transmission of electrical impulses, including arrhythmias)
- Neurological issues (including weakness, decreased reflexes and paralysis)
- Mg depletion can lead to:
- Decreased K uptake in the nephrons, which may lead to excess renal losses and may impair cellular transport of K
- Thiamine depletion can lead to:
- Cardiac issues (including cardiac myocytes, cardiac failure, wet beriberi, peripheral vasodilation, elevated cardiac output, decreased cardiac contractility, dysrhythmias, and low diastolic blood pressure)
- Neurological issues (includes confusion, encephalopathy)
- Lactic acidemia

## Refeeding Syndrome - Severity Definitions

- Mild Refeeding Syndrome - decrease in serum K, Phos, or Mg by 10-20%
- Moderate Refeeding Syndrome - decrease in serum K, Phos, or Mg by 20-30%
- Severe Refeeding Syndrome - decrease in serum K, Phos, or Mg by &gt;30%, severe organ dysfunction, and/or thiamine deficiency

# Refeeding Syndrome - Risk Indicators

[tbl-90.html](tbl-90.html)

---

<!-- Page 191 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

# Refeeding Syndrome - Labs

## Initial Labs
- Check K, Phos, and Mg before any nutrition intake (including IV fluids, oral nutrition, enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition)

## Ongoing Labs
- High risk patients - recheck K, Phos, and Mg labs a minimum of every 6-12 hours initially
- Moderate risk patients - recheck K, Phos, and Mg labs every 12-24 hours initially
- Mild risk patients - recheck K, Phos, and Mg labs every 24 hours initially
- Adjust lab frequency based on lab results and repletion needs

## Repleting Low Labs
- Consider adding K and/or Phos to IV fluids for baseline repletion
- Consider IV (preferred) or enteral/oral K, Phos, and/or Mg replacements as appropriate
- Note: frequent lab checks can show early trends and can help prevent severe refeeding syndrome

# Refeeding Syndrome - Supplements

## Thiamine Supplementation
- Start 2 mg/kg/day (maximum of 100-200 mg/day) before any nutrition intake (IV fluids, oral, etc)
- IV (preferred) or enteral/oral
- Continue for 5-7 days (adjust PRN per clinical need and refeeding syndrome status)
- Checking thiamine lab is unlikely to be of value and is not necessary

## Multivitamin Supplementation
- Once medically able, start a complete multivitamin enteral/oral, continue for at least 10 days

# Refeeding Syndrome - Inpatient Nutrition Management
- The goal of medical nutrition therapy for refeeding syndrome is prevention of lab and medical issues with slow advancement of calorie intake (from all sources, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats)

## Labs
- Obtain baseline refeeding labs, including K, Phos, and Mg
- Correct lab abnormalities before initiating and/or advancing nutrition (including dextrose containing IV fluids and oral, enteral and/or parenteral nutrition)
- Note: dextrose 5% has been observed to lead to refeeding syndrome
- Refer to refeeding syndrome lab section of this chapter for additional information

188

<!-- Page 192 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook
189

- Supplements
- Start a thiamine supplement and a multivitamin
- Refer to refeeding syndrome supplement section of this chapter for additional information

- Calorie Advancement
- Consider the following for calorie increases:
- Day 1 of nutrition-maximum 20-25% of the calorie goal
- Day 2 of nutrition-maximum 40-50% of the calorie goal
- Day 3 of nutrition-maximum 60-75% of the calorie goal
- Day 4 of nutrition-maximum 80-100% of the calorie goal
- Adjust advancement based on refeeding labs and repletion needs
- If no lab issues by day 2-3, advance intake faster
- If significant lab issues, advance intake slower

- Oral Nutrition Considerations
- Once oral intake is offered:
- If excessive oral calorie intake is not anticipated
- Allow normalized dietary intake without restrictions and close monitoring of nutritional intake and refeeding labs
- Examples: patients with restrictive eating habits, gastrointestinal issues, etc
- If excessive oral calorie intake is anticipated
- Consider initial oral intake restrictions (including all foods, beverages, and oral supplements) with slow calorie advancement to prevent refeeding syndrome
- Examples: patients with food insecurity, abuse and neglect, etc
- Example of Oral Nutrition Advancement Plan:
- Calorie Controlled Diet – initial diet order
- Divide the daily calorie goal into 4-5 times/day
- Limit calorie containing beverages and oral supplements initially to encourage intake from a variety of solid foods
- Day 1 of nutrition-maximum of 100 kcals x 5/day
- Day 2 of nutrition-maximum of 200kcals x 5/day
- Day 3 of nutrition-maximum of 300 kcals x 5/day
- Day 4 of nutrition-maximum of 400 kcals x 5/day
- Regular Diet—once normalized calorie intake and no refeeding syndrome concerns

Chapter 11 ANEMIA

## Anemia – Hematology Related

- The bone marrow produces red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets
- RBCs – through oxygen binding to Hemoglobin (Hgb), deliver oxygen to tissues
- WBCs – part of the immune system
- Platelets – part of blood clotting
- RBC formation requires many nutrients—protein, iron, and micronutrients (including vitamins)
- Anemia is generally defined as a reduction in the number of RBCs in the blood, seen as low RBCs, Hemoglobin (Hgb), and Hematocrit (Hct)

## Anemia – General Symptoms

- Most common—lethargy/fatigue, pallor (i.e. conjunctiva, nail beds)
- Additional – weakness, headache, dizziness, irritability
- Iron deficiency often develops slowly, therefore symptoms may be minimal due to body adaptations
- The goal of nutrition therapy is to identify and correct nutritional deficiencies

## Anemia – Types

### Nutritional Anemias

- Iron Deficiency – see separate section for information
- Vitamin B12 Deficiency – see separate section for information
- Folic Acid/Folate Deficiency – see separate section for information

### Anemia of Chronic Disease

- Condition of impaired iron utilization and possibly RBC production
- Most commonly associated with infection, cancer, inflammation, or chronic autoimmune disease
- Iron supplementation is not indicated and may be harmful

## Anemia – Iron Deficiency

### General

- Iron deficiency is defined as insufficient total body iron for normal functions
- Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia worldwide
- Iron deficiency is typically a progressive change that occurs in stages, affecting laboratory findings

### Causes

- Inadequate dietary iron intake
- Excessive cow’s milk intake (related to no iron content, high calcium content interfering with other iron intake absorption, and displacement of nutrition from other food sources)

---

<!-- Page 195 -->

- Decreased iron absorption (highest absorption in the duodenum)
- Increased requirements (i.e. pregnancy)
- Chronic blood loss (i.e. menstrual, gastrointestinal, blood draws/donations)
- Medical conditions

## Symptoms

- See “Anemia – General Symptoms”
- Additional-pica (intense craving of nonfood items such as ice, dirt, rocks, paper), glossitis, angular stomatitis, koilonychia (fingernails thin and brittle with concave/spoon shape)

## Infants

- Breastfeeding without adequate iron intake
- Transition to cow’s milk before the recommended age of 1 year old
- Recommended Iron Intake (without deficiency):
- 0-6 months old – no significant iron sources needed, due to adequate stores at birth
- 7-12 months old – 11 mg/day; sources include infant formula, iron containing age-appropriate foods and/or iron supplement (i.e. MVI with Iron or ferrous sulfate)

## Children and Adolescents

- Recommended Iron Intake (without deficiency):
- 1-3 years old – 7 mg/day boys and girls
- 4-8 years old – 10 mg/day boys and girls
- 9-13 years old – 8 mg/day boys and girls
- 14-18 years old – 11 mg/day boys and 15 mg/day girls

- Sources include iron containing age-appropriate foods (see “Food Sources of Iron”), oral nutrition supplements, and/or iron supplement (i.e. pediatric MVI with Iron or ferrous sulfate)

## Food Sources

- Heme Iron
- From animal sources; iron is more readily absorbed (than non-heme iron)
- Examples: oysters, clams, mussels, organ meats, beef, pork, poultry

- Non-heme Iron
- From plant sources; iron is less readily absorbed (than heme iron)
- Examples: iron fortified cereals and breads, beans, legumes, spinach, nuts, seeds

- Iron absorption is increased when consumed with a source of vitamin C (i.e. citrus fruits)
- Iron absorption is decreased when consuming high intake of phytates (i.e. whole grains, soy, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds), tannins (i.e. tea, coffee), and calcium sources

---

<!-- Page 196 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook
193

- Milk Intake
- Whole cow’s milk (or soy milk as an alternative) should be introduced at 1 year of age
- Soy milk can be given as an plant based alternative to whole cow’s milk
- Other plant based milks (i.e. rice milk, almond milk, oat milk) are typically lower in essential nutrients (including calories, fat, and protein)
- Maximum recommended intake is 16-20 oz/day

Anemia – Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Deficiency

- General
- Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is also referred to as one type of megaloblastic macrocytic anemia
- Pernicious anemia is type of vitamin B12 deficiency that is caused by intrinsic factor deficiency

- Causes
- Long term inadequate dietary iron intake (i.e. low intake overall, vegan diet, alcoholism)
- Decreased absorption (i.e. gastrointestinal diseases, bariatric surgery, intrinsic factor deficiency)
- Increased requirements (i.e. pregnancy)
- Medication (i.e. protein pump inhibitors, metformin, histamine receptor antagonists)
- Medical conditions (i.e. rare genetic disorders, liver disease)

- Symptoms
- See “Anemia – General Symptoms”
- Additional – beefy red tongue, glossitis, neurological problems

- Infants
- Breastfed infants, of mothers that are vitamin B12 deficient, are at risk development delays and neurological damage; vitamin B12 supplement is needed
- Sources include breast milk from mothers with adequate vitamin B12 intake, infant formula, and age-appropriate foods (see “Food Sources of Vitamin B12”)

- Children and Adolescents
- Sources include vitamin B12 intake from age-appropriate foods (see “Food Sources of Vitamin B12”, oral nutrition supplements, and/or MVI supplement)

- Food Sources
- Clams, liver, beef, pork, poultry, fish, eggs, milk and fortified products (i.e. cereal, soy milk)

## Causes
- Long term inadequate dietary iron intake
- Decreased absorption (i.e. gastrointestinal diseases, bariatric surgery)
- Increased requirements (i.e. pregnancy)
- Medications (i.e. methotrexate, sulfasalazine, phenytoin, phenobarbital)
- Medical conditions (i.e. rare genetic disorders)

## Symptoms
- See "Anemia - General Symptoms"

## Anemia – Steps to Diagnosis Nutrition Related Anemia

- Step 1: Review the Complete Blood Count (CBC)
- Step 2: Determine if there is anemia present based on low levels of RBCs, Hgb (preferred), and Hct
- Step 3: Determine if the MCV is low, normal or high
- Low MCV = high concern for iron deficiency anemia
- Check additional labs-iron, ferritin, and TIBC (or transferrin) to confirm diagnosis
- High MCV = high concern for vitamin B12 or folic acid/folate deficiency
- Check additional labs-vitamin B12 and folate to confirm diagnosis

Chapter 12 CARDIOLOGY

## PART 1 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE (CHD)

### CHD – General Information

- CHD increases the risk for malnutrition and growth failure due to increased tachypnea and tachycardia leading to increased energy expenditure
- CHD leads to inadequate nutrient intake due to fatigue, fluid restriction, reflux/emesis, frequent NPO, vocal cord paresis, etc
- Insufficient utilization of nutrients due to hypoxia, acidosis and decreased splanchnic blood flow
- Increased nutrient losses due to protein losing enteropathy or chyle output
- CHD patients have increased nutrition risk, including, but not limited to:
- Double outlet right ventricle (DORV), Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and a large Ventricular septal defect (VSD), DiGeorge (22q11 deletion), Trisomy 18 and 13, CHARGE and VACTERL syndromes

### CHD – Protein Losing Enteropathy (PLE)

- A complication frequently seen after the Fontan operation; it is thought to be due to prolonged elevated pressure in the superior vena cava which damages the thoracic duct and limits lymphatic drainage
- The damage results in protein loss from the gastrointestinal tract and results in edema, ascites and/or pleural/pericardial effusions
- Most commonly occurs between ages 2-10 years old in 13% of Fontan patients
- Nutrition management:
- Limited research is available, but general practice is based on severity of symptoms
- Diet and formula: high protein, low long chain fat, high medium chain fat

### CHD – Gastrointestinal Issues

- Gastroesophageal reflux in CHD infants is very common and usually managed with medications and reflux precautions during/after feedings
- Malrotation is common with CHD infants with Heterotaxy syndrome and results in frequent emesis; smaller bolus feeds administered slowly may help relieve symptoms

### CHD – Vocal Cord Paresis

- Risk factors include manipulation of the laryngeal nerve during surgery and undergoing transesophageal echocardiography
- Most common in aortic arch repairs and single ventricle operations
- Symptoms include stridor, hoarse or wheezy cry
- Signs of aspiration with oral intake include coughing, choking, watering eyes, desaturations and upper airway noise

# CHD - Chylothorax

- Accumulation of chyle within the pleural space after damage to the thoracic duct
- Diagnosed when pleural triglycerides are &gt;110 mg/dL and the ratio of the pleural fluid to serum cholesterol is &lt;1
- Nutrition management:
- Chylous effusions can be improved/resolved with nutritional changes for the majority of patients
- Diet: Low fat or very low fat diet
- Formula (oral and enteral nutrition): low in long chain fatty acids, high in medium chain fatty acids or fat-free
- Parenteral nutrition: used when chylous output does not improve with diet and/or formula restrictions
- Multivitamins: may require fat-soluble vitamins in water-soluble form
- Essential fatty acids:
- Supplementation is needed to prevent deficiency within 2-4 weeks of inadequate intake
- Symptoms of deficiency include eczema, skin lesions, poor wound healing and thrombocytopenia
- Refer to CHD - Nutrient Needs for requirements
- Note: 1 mL soy oil = 0.45 g linoleic fatty acid and 0.06 g linolenic fatty acids

# CHD - Therapeutic Diet or Formula Needs

## Infants

- Preoperative feeding is recommended when the infant is hemodynamically stable with or without prostaglandin infusion
- Human milk feedings are preferred pre- and postoperatively
- Utilize feeding protocol (i.e. start feeds at 1 mL/kg/hr, increase by 1 mL/kg/hr every 4-6 hours to goal of 5 mL/kg/hr)
- Monitor for aspiration with vocal cord paralysis, tachypnea and tachycardia
- May require an oral/po feeding time limit to avoid excessive energy expenditure; avoid oral intake with respiratory rate &gt;60-65 breaths per minute (example order: maximum 10-15 minutes po/feed, provide remaining feed volume via NG tube over 30 min; PO only with RR &lt;60)
- Meet calorie requirements with fluid restrictions
- Increase formula concentration by 2-4 kcal/oz per day (as tolerated) to maximum of 30 kcal/oz (i.e. Similac Advance 30 kcal/oz or Similac Advance 28 kcal/oz + 2 kcal/oz Liquigen = 30 kcal/oz)
- Fortify expressed breast milk (EBM) with formula (e.g. EBM 20 kcal/oz + Similac Advance powder 10 kcal/oz = 30 kcal/oz)
- Provide high calorie additives such as soy oil, MCT oil or Liquigen (i.e. MCT oil 3 ml BID) Avoid adding oil to bottles and feeding bags since they can separate from the milk
- Monitor for GI tolerance due to increased osmolarity which occurs with concentrated feeds and/or elemental formulas

---

<!-- Page 203 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook
200

- Children
- Regular diet
- Provide oral supplements as needed for additional calories
- High calorie additives such as Liquigen or Duocal added to foods and liquids
- May require supplemental tube feeds during the day or overnight for poor oral/po intake

CHD – Education Needs
- Formula mixing and Breast milk fortification education
- Prescribed diet and/or nutrient or fluid restrictions
- Women Infants and Children (WIC) prescription

CHD – Medications
- Furosemide (Lasix) – risk of electrolyte losses and bone mineral density losses
- Digoxin – risk of decreased appetite/anorexia
- Bethanechol – risk of diarrhea
- Vasopressors – may be unable to feed enterally, dose dependent

CHD – Labs
- Fluid status shifts/changes: albumin and BUN
- Protein Losing Enteropathy: albumin may be low if symptomatic, stool alpha-1-antitrypsin and total lymphocyte count
- DiGeorge Syndrome: calcium and vitamin D due to risk of hypocalcemia
- CHD Severity: B-type natriuretic peptide
- Essential fatty acid deficiency: Tetrene:Trene Ratio, fat-soluble vitamin levels
- Other: serum electrolytes, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin D 25-hydroxy

PART 2 CHOLESTEROL (CHOL)

CHOL – General Information
- Dietary interventions should be the first line of defense for lowering cholesterol levels
- Any patient &gt;2 years of age with any of the following cardiovascular disease risk factors should have a fasting lipid profile performed:
- A parent, aunt, uncle or grandparents with heart disease &lt;55 years (male) or &lt;65 years (female)
- A parent with a total cholesterol &gt;240 mg/dL
- A family history that is not available (i.e. adopted child)
- Other cardiovascular disease risk factors: obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, congenital heart disease, renal disease
- Treatment with retinoid acid, anticonvulsants or oral contraceptives

Chapter 13 CRITICAL CARE

## Critical Care – General Information

- Overall goal is to promote positive nitrogen balance, prevent catabolism and improving quality of life during pediatric critical illness through nutrition
- Age-appropriate growth is often not feasible during acute critical illness
- Due to the metabolic stress response of critical illness, changes are seen in protein, carbohydrate (including glucose), and lipid metabolism
- Initiate nutrition support within 24-48 hours of admission
- Achieve a minimum of 65% of nutrition support goal by the end of the first week

# Critical Care - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)

- ECMO is available in the critical care setting if additional respiratory and/or cardiac support is needed
- Available types:
- VV (veno-venous) ECMO - provides additional respiratory support
- VA (veno-arterial) ECMO - provides additional respiratory and cardiac support
- Once hemodynamically stable on ECMO, enteral nutrition is preferred form of nutrition support
- Refer to the "Critical Care - General Nutrition Needs" table for nutrient needs

# Critical Care - Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT)

- CRRT is used in the critical care setting (instead of hemodialysis) to minimize large fluid shifts
- CRRT can provide clearance (medications, labs, etc) and/or removal of fluid
- Available types: Continuous Veno-venous Hemofiltration and/or Dialysis (i.e. CVVH, CVVHD, and CVVHDF)

# Chapter 14 CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF)

## CF - General Information

- The CF Foundation guidelines for appropriate growth and weight gain are as follows:
- 0-2 years old: weight-for-length &gt;50th percentile (World Health Organization growth charts)
- 2-20 years old: BMI &gt;50th percentile (Center for Disease Control growth charts)
- &gt;20 years old: BMI &gt;22 kg/m2 (females) and BMI &gt;23 kg/m2 (males)

## CF - Nutrition Needs (DRI for age unless noted below)

[tbl-10.html](tbl-10.html)

## CF - Therapeutic Diet or Formula Needs

- Infants
- Often need concentrated breast milk or formula
- Use standard formula unless intolerance of standard formula is demonstrated
- Start solid foods at 4-6 months old with meats first and add 1 tsp fat per 1/4 cup baby food

---

<!-- Page 214 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook
211

- Children and Adolescents
- High calorie, healthy high fat diet (focus on Mediterranean style eating)
- Continue whole milk throughout entire life
- Oral supplements as needed (i.e. PediaSure®, PediaSure® 1.5 Cal, Carnation® Breakfast Essentials™, PediaSure® Peptide 1.5)
- Patients on highly effective modulator therapy (Kalydeco® and Trikafta®) should have individualize diet recommendations due to concern for rapid weight gain.

CF - Labs
- Fecal elastase to determine pancreatic sufficiency (PS) versus insufficiency (PI)
- Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase to evaluate for CF related liver disease
- Lipase and amylase to evaluate for pancreatitis (in patients who are PS)
- Albumin, prealbumin, iron, zinc
- Fat soluble vitamins - see "evaluating vitamin status" section

CF - Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT)
- Enzymes are taken immediately before all meals and snacks that contain fat and/or protein
- Only use brand name enzymes (no generic or plant-based enzymes)
- Dosage is calculated on the units of lipase/capsule and the patient's weight
- Dosage ranges from 1000-2500 lipase units/kg/meal; maximum 14,000 lipase units/kg/day (0-1 year old) and 10,000 lipase units/kg/day (1 year and older)
- Capsules are swallowed whole or opened and mixed with soft, acidic foods (preferably applesauce)
- When taken orally, enzyme beads should not be crushed or chewed
- To administer pancreatic enzymes via duodenal or jejunal feeding tubes:
- Crush enzyme beads
- Dissolve 10,000 units lipase in 800 mg sodium bicarbonate
- Some enzyme activity may be lost with this method
- To administer pancreatic enzymes via gastric feeding tubes:
- Leave the enzyme beads whole
- Open the enzyme capsule in 50-100 mL of nectar-thickened water or juice
- Use a straight tip syringe to administer enzymes (not a luer lock syringe) to draw up the enzyme beads and administer the beads with slow pressure
- Flush the tube with water
- Small bore feeding tubes (&lt;10 French) may clog with whole enzyme beads
- RELiZORB® (inline lipase cartridge) is approved for use in patients 5 years and older

# CF - Evaluating Vitamin Status

- **Vitamin A** - evaluate retinol level
- Retinol may be falsely low during acute illness
- Retinol may be a beneficial supplement for patients with a history of bowel resections when levels are not responding to beta-carotene
- Evaluate vitamin A: retinol binding protein (RBP) molar ratio
- Convert to retinol (μg/dL) × 0.0349 = μmol/L
- RBP (mg/dL) × 0.476 μmol/L
- Divide 1st step by the 2nd step = normal 0.8-1, suggestive of toxicity &gt;1
- Supplement zinc and/or copper if deficient
- Consider decreasing vitamin A supplementation if voriconazole started to prevent visual disturbances and adverse skin effects

- **Vitamin D** - evaluate 25-hydroxy level
- The dose of vitamin D that achieves &gt;30 is the new maintenance; do not decrease or discontinue supplementation
- Recheck level at least 12 weeks after adjusting dose

- **Vitamin E** - evaluate alpha-tocopherol
- Levels are often elevated in younger children; may be due to a non-fasting level or consumption of vitamins prior to lab draw
- Falsely low when the blood is exposed to light or during acute illness
- Check the ratio alpha-tocopherol (mg/L):(cholesterol + triglyceride (g/L))
- Any value &lt;0.8 indicates deficiency

- **Vitamin K**
- Vitamin A supplementation interferes with absorption of vitamin K
- Check for clotting factor deficiencies
- PIVKA-II or des-y-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) are the gold standard to evaluate vitamin K status
- PT and INR may be more easily checked
- Recheck levels in 4-6 weeks after adjusting dose of supplements

# CF - Vitamin Supplementation

- Need cystic fibrosis-specific multivitamin or over-the-counter multivitamin daily
- Supplement individual fat-soluble vitamins if serum levels are low
- Take all vitamins with pancreatic enzymes

# CF - Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD)

- Usually present in adult patients but can occur at any age
- Pancreas does not produce enough insulin to meet the cystic fibrosis patient's elevated energy needs
- Count carbohydrates and use insulin to carbohydrate ratios to dose insulin
- Continue a high calorie, healthy high fat diet
- Encourage sugar-free beverages
- Oral glucose tolerance test is standard test for diagnosis, starting at age 10 years old

---

<!-- Page 216 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook
213

# CF - Cystic Fibrosis Related Bone Disease (CFBD)

- Affects 20-35% of adults with CF
- Encourage adequate calcium intake at all ages
- Maintain adequate vitamin D 25 hydroxy and vitamin K levels
- Encourage weight bearing exercises
- Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) taken by age 18 years old (or by age 8 years old if high-risk)

# CF - Cystic Fibrosis Related Liver Disease (CFLD)

- Ranges from asymptomatic elevated ALT (in 85% of youth), cirrhosis (in 2-3% of youth), or portal hypertension (in 10% of youth)
- May need at least 1.5 times estimated calorie needs
- Focus on a healthy, high fat diet, including medium chain triglycerides
- Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation may increase
- Liver enzymes and bilirubin are checked annually at a minimum

- Meal plans for infants &lt;12 months of age should consist of a minimum of 15 g of CHO per meal (a maximum is not needed)
- Meal plans for toddlers 12-24 months old can either consist of a minimum CHO amount (&gt;130 g CHO daily), a set CHO range, or ICR depending on the patient's needs

## DM – Children and Adolescents

### Set CHO Method

- Indicated for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin
- Focus on CHO counting, with an emphasis on serving/portion size and the impact on CHO amount, and maintaining schedule
- Avoid sugar sweetened beverages, juices, and candies due to concentrated simple CHO content; encourage high fiber foods, abundant vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat dairy foods
- Meals: Set 5 g CHO range (i.e. 45-50 g) for patients on insulin. Increase or decrease CHO by 5-15 g at a time when meal plan needs adjustment
- Refer to table 15.1

### Insulin to CHO Ratios (ICR) Method

- Determines how much insulin is needed as a bolus dose to cover the amount of CHO in a meal or snack
- Indicated for type 1 and type 2 patients on insulin
- Provides increased flexibility
- Set at 1 unit of rapid-acting insulin (i.e. Humalog®, NovoLog®, Apidra®) per g of CHO (i.e. 1:15 ratio = 1 unit insulin for every 15 g CHO)
- Only used at meals where rapid-acting insulin is given or to cover snacks with &gt;15 g of CHO if approved by patient's endocrinologist
- Refer to table 15.1

### No Concentrated Sweet Diet

- Indicated for patients not requiring insulin therapy but exhibiting hyperglycemia

215

- Low Fat Diet
- May be indicated for patients with hyperlipidemia or elevated liver enzymes

- Oral Supplements
- Most oral formulas can be considered as long as insulin coverage is provided based on the CHO content
- Avoid clear liquid supplements as they contain no fat and may cause rapid spikes in blood sugar

- Enteral Formula
- Use a standard tube feeding formula (~50% CHO) or a diabetes-specific formula (33-40% CHO) if nutrient needs are appropriately met, such as PediaSure® Enteral with Fiber or Glucerna®

Table 15.1 Meals - Set CHO and ICR Methods

[tbl-11.html](tbl-11.html)

DM - Snacks

- Daytime
- These snacks are optional
- Keep snacks at least two hours between CHO containing meals and snacks
- Generally, for snacks ≤15 g CHO, then ICR insulin not needed, but this can vary based on the patient's needs

- Bedtime
- If blood glucose is less than target - required snack of 15 g CHO
- If blood glucose is within target - optional snack of ≤15 g CHO if hungry
- If blood glucose is above target - no snack, but can have a "free food" (&lt;5 g CHO/serving) or zero CHO snack if hungry

- Note: "free food" (&lt;5 g CHO/serving) and zero CHO snacks may be eaten at any time

# DM - Education Needs

## CHO Counting

- Identifying the exact number of CHO in specific servings of food items by using the food labels and CHO counting guides
- This is the standard of care for diabetes education

## CHO Choices

- Based on the philosophy that 15 g of CHO is one choice, 30 g of CHO is 2 choices, etc
- This can be used for education if there is concern for low literacy level or low comprehension

## Nutrition Awareness in Food Selection

- For all patients, educate on food selection to promote optimal health. Include the importance of limiting foods high in saturated fat and sodium
- Modest weight loss for any overweight/obese child may provide clinical benefits
- If patient is CHO counting, consider giving a CHO limit at mealtimes (ex. max 60 g CHO) to facilitate appropriate calorie intake; limit should be based on ~40-50% of total goal calories from CHO foods
- The Diabetes Plate Method is a simple, effective tool for building balanced meals
- 1/2 of plate should be non-starchy veggies
- 1/4 of plate should be protein items
- 1/4 of plate should be carbohydrates DM - Labs
- Consider checking the following: blood glucose, urine ketones, hemoglobin (Hgb) A1C, lipid panel

[tbl-12.html](tbl-12.html)

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

# DM - Exercise

- Check blood sugar prior to exercise; recheck it every hour during exercise and 2-3 hours after exercise
- Do not exercise if ketones are present
- In general, eat a snack containing 10-30 g CHO for every 30-45 minutes of moderate physical activity (actual need may vary by individual and activity)
- Continue to monitor blood glucose closely after exercise as delayed hypoglycemia may occur for up to 24 hours
- If strenuous exercise in late afternoon/evening, consider adding 15g CHO to bedtime snack
- If bedtime blood glucose less than 90 mg/dL, check blood glucose around 2-3 am
- Encourage at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day and break up sedentary time (&gt;90 minutes)

# IBD - Nutrition Needs (DRI for age unless noted below)

[tbl-16.html](tbl-16.html)

# IBD - Therapeutic Diet or Formula Needs

- Diet recommendations individualized
- General healthy diet with adequate calories, protein and nutrients
- Avoid 'trigger' foods
- May need to avoid high insoluble fiber indigestible foods, such as corn, nuts, seeds and popcorn
- Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) used in Crohn's disease to induce remission by mouth or via feeding tube: various protocols but usually exclusive for 8-12 weeks
- May use polymeric or hydrolyzed formulas; research shows outcomes do not differ based on formula composition for growth or induction of remission
- Other therapeutic diet options for treatment of IBD include Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) or Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) however, please consult with GI Dietitian prior to initiation to see if patient would be a good candidate - diets are highly restrictive, and compliance may be difficult

# IBD - Education Needs

- Small frequent meals with decreased high fat, greasy foods to minimize abdominal cramping
- Low fiber, low residue diet for presentation of strictures
- Lactose intolerance can be present with increased motility or upper intestinal Crohn's with increased inflammation; provide DRI for calcium daily
- Recommend daily multivitamin
- Use oral rehydration solutions for high stool output

PART 5 INTESTINAL FAILURE

Intestinal Failure - General Information

- Defined as a critical reduction of functional gut mass below the minimum amount necessary for adequate digestion and absorption to satisfy nutrient and fluid requirements in adults or growth in children
- The main goals of an intestinal rehabilitation program are enteral autonomy, optimization of growth and minimization of parenteral nutrition (PN) associated complications
- Complications depend on the length, surgical anatomy, and age of remaining bowel
- Most common complications include malabsorptive diarrhea, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, micronutrient deficiencies, gastric hypersecretion, anastomotic ulcers, and small bowel bacterial overgrowth
- Of note, intestinal failure patients are also at risk for pancreatic insufficiency and kidney stones
- Average intestinal lengths:
- Premature infants (19-27 weeks): ~150 cm total small bowel and colon
- Full term neonate: ~240 cm small bowel and ~40 cm colon
- Adult: ~600 cm small bowel and ~150 cm colon

Intestinal Failure - Therapeutic Diet or Formula Needs

- Diet
- Solid foods should be introduced when age appropriate, usually with rice cereal that is soy oil free, followed by stage 1 vegetables
- Encourage adding small amount of salt to meats and vegetables
- To increase calories, mix low calories vegetables with cereal or small amount of fat
- Avoid concentrated sweets in diet
- Allow fruit sparingly and provide with a meal

- Formula
- Examples: breast milk, Pregestimil®, Neocate® Infant/Junior/Splash, Elecare® Infant/Junior, PediaSure® Peptide 1.0 Cal, PediaSure® Peptide 1.5 Cal, Peptamen® Jr, Tolerex®, Vivonex® Pediatric, Vivonex® RTF, Nourish®, Liquid Hope®, Kate Farms®, Compleat Pediatric®, and Compleat Pediatric Organic Blends®1.2
- Addition of fiber (as Nutrisource® Fiber or pectin) may be helpful in children with loose stools
- Nutrisource® Fiber: start at 0.5 g/100 mL formula, increase PRN to 1.5 g/100 mL formula
- Pectin: start at 1 mL/100 mL formula, increase PRN to maximum 3 ml/100 mL formula

226

---

<!-- Page 230 -->

- Continuous tube feedings are often helpful to maximize absorption
- May need to increase volume and concentration of formula very slowly to maximize tolerance, typically by 1 mL/hr every 5-7 days
- Feeding advancement is limited to keep stool or ostomy output less than 30-50 mL/kg/day
- Small amounts of EN should be started as soon as possible as luminal substrates and nutrients are essentials for intestinal adaptation, the process by which the remaining intestine may begin to compensate for the roles typically performed by the rejected sections of bowel

### Parenteral

- Once enteral/oral caloric absorption is demonstrated, PN kcal intake may be reduced by cutting down hours (typically by 2 hours at a time) and/or volume
- Once receiving ≤8 hours PN daily, days/week of PN can be decreased
- In the case of PN related cholestasis, remove manganese and decrease copper provided by half
- Urinary sodium - goal of &gt;30 mEq/L; sodium provision in PN should be titrated accordingly
- Essential fatty acids - for long term intake of lipids, monitor labs every 6-12 months

### Intestinal Failure - Nutrition Needs (DRI for age unless noted below)

[tbl-17.html](tbl-17.html)

### Intestinal Failure - Education Needs

- No concentrated sweets diet

### Intestinal Failure - Labs

- Electrolytes, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium
- Triglycerides
- Liver Function Tests-ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin
- Vitamin B12 and zinc-monitor every 6-12 months depending on disease severity and presence of ileum
- If on PN-zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, selenium, retinol (vitamin A), vitamin D 25 hydroxy, PT/INR(vitamin K), alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E); monitor every 6-12 months

- Calorie and protein needs are increased due to increased cardiac output and red blood cell production
- The incidence of pain crises may be reduced by optimizing nutritional status
- Often shorter in stature compared to other children their age
- May have a delayed onset of puberty and appear younger than their actual age

### Sickle Cell - Therapeutic Diet or Formula Needs

- Regular diet is appropriate for most patients
- High calorie/high protein diet may be indicated if growth is below goals
- High calorie oral supplements may be helpful in patients with baseline increased calorie needs or with poor intake during pain crisis

# Chapter 19 INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM

## Inborn Errors of Metabolism – General Information

- The goal of nutrition therapy is to promote normal growth and development while preventing metabolic crisis and neurological damage.
- Many factors affect accuracy of newborn screen, therefore cannot diagnosis or start diet without confirmation and diagnosis from a metabolic specialist.

## Inborn Errors of Metabolism – Nutrition Needs (DRI for age unless noted below)

- Studies have shown that patients with inborn errors of metabolism may require increased amounts of some nutrients above the RDAs.
- A dietitian should be consulted prior to prescribing specialized metabolic formulas or parenteral nutrition.

Disorders of Long-Chain Fatty Acid Metabolism

[tbl-25.html](tbl-25.html)

## Inborn Errors of Metabolism – Therapeutic Diet or Formula Needs

- No patient should receive metabolic formula until seen and diagnosed by the metabolic physician.
- No patient should receive ONLY metabolic formula for extended period due to risk of deficiency. Patients must receive some intact protein as well (from food, standard formula, or breast milk).
- Metabolic Formula General Guidelines (if using Abbott® metabolic formulas):
- Stage 1 for &lt;4 years old
- Stage 2 for &gt;4 years old
- Limit amino acids supplied by infant formula, expressed breast milk, cow's milk, table foods, or supplements (i.e. Pediasure); metabolic formulas supply other nutrients including calories, vitamins and minerals.
- Many metabolic patients (&gt;1 year old) mix metabolic formula with some type of flavoring (i.e. Strawberry Nesquik, MiO, Kool-aid, Hawaiian Punch, etc.) or are on a “mixed prescription” (multiple products) to meet needs and promote compliance.

# Inborn Errors of Metabolism - Phenylketonuria (PKU)

## Formula

- Phenylalanine-free, elemental formula or glycomacropetide-based formula that is low phenylalanine
- Formula should be consumed throughout the day with meals or snacks to promote better absorption and satiety
- Additional metabolic formula can be consumed based on hunger

## Diet

- Low protein, phenylalanine-restricted diet
- Consumption of aspartame is contraindicated; see nutrition label for "Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine"

## Counting Methods

- 1 g protein = -50 mg phenylalanine = -3 exchanges
- 1 exchange = 15 mg of phenylalanine = -0.375 g protein

## Medications

- KUVAN® (sapropterin dihydrochloride) is a medication utilized to improve serum phenylalanine levels in conjunction with diet therapy; not all patients respond to drug therapy

## Labs

- A patient's phenylalanine prescription is based on plasma phenylalanine levels
- Treatment range for plasma phenylalanine: 2-6 mg/dL or 120-360 μmol/L (to covert μmol/L to mg/dL, divide value by 60)
- Other labs: tyrosine, plasma amino acids, prealbumin, nutritional anemia profile, vitamin and mineral status, EFA sufficiency

# Inborn Errors of Metabolism - Other Disorders of Amino Acid Metabolism

## Formula and Diet

- Patients are usually on a protein-restricted diet and a metabolic formula

## During Acute Illness

- Avoid fasting and dehydration
- High energy intake required to avoid catabolism (100-150% of home intake)
- Protein intake adjusted based on labs: protein intake may be discontinued initially, then restarted slowly with protein from metabolic formula: protein intake is increased as tolerated to home intake

## Medications

- Orfadin® (nitisinone) is a medication used in conjunction with low protein diet for patients with tyrosinemia type 1
- Cystadane® (betaine) is a medication used in conjunction with a low protein diet to lower plasma homocysteine levels with Classical Homocystinuria
- Some patients are on an L-carnitine supplement or a single-amino acid supplement

# Chapter 20 KETOGENIC DIET (KETO)

## KETO - General Information

- Ketogenic diet was developed in the 1920's and consists of a very high fat diet with adequate protein and minimal carbohydrates, containing three to five times as much fat as carbohydrate and protein combined
- The ketogenic diet mimics the body's metabolism during fasting, which has been recognized as a means of controlling seizures for centuries
- The ketogenic diet derives energy from metabolizing fat as an energy source rather than glucose and glycogen
- Multiple studies show more than half of children on the ketogenic diet will have their seizures improve; about one third will have up to a 90% reduction in seizures
- Used as first line treatment for Glucose transport type 1 deficiency (Glut-1), pyruvate dehydrogenase defect (PDHD), and phosphofructokinase deficiency
- Particularly effective or used early on in treatment for: Dravet syndrome, Angelman's syndrome, infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, intractable epilepsy with feeding tube access or sole source nutrition from formula.
- Prior to starting any diet therapy for seizure control, check for metabolic conditions that would contraindicate use of the diet

## KETO - Nutrition Needs (DRI for age unless noted below)

[tbl-26.html](tbl-26.html)

## KETO - Formula

- Ketogenic Formulas
- Ratio can be decreased by adding Beneprotein® cornstarch, table sugar, breast milk or traditional formulas
- Ratio can be increased by adding cooking oil, MCT oil or Liquigen®
- Product Examples:
- KetoCal 4:1 LQ (unflavored and vanilla)
- KetoCal 4:1 powder
- KetoCal 3:1 powder

---

<!-- Page 245 -->

- KetoCal 2.5:1 (vanilla)
- KetoVie 4:1 (chocolate, vanilla and unflavored)
- KetoVie Peptide 4:1
- KetoVie 3:1 (unflavored)
- KetoVie 4:1 Plant Based Protein Vanilla
- Functional Formularies KETO

## Formula Supplements
- Formulas typically meet vitamin/mineral needs
- Add supplements as needed

## KETO – Therapeutic Diet Needs

### Ketogenic Diet
- Initiation of diet usually takes place in a hospital setting
- The diet is based on ratio of grams fat to grams protein and carbohydrate combined
- Ratios can vary from 2:1 to 4.5:1
- Menus are created for families, specific to their ratio; ketodietcalculator.org or a similar program can be used for recipe creation
- Meals usually contain liquid heavy whipping cream, fat, fruit or vegetable and protein
- All foods must be weighed on a gram scale

### MCT Diet
- Initiation of diet usually takes place in a hospital setting
- The diet is approximately 70% fat with 30-60% coming from MCT oil
- Protein will meet DRI minimum for age or near 10-15% total calories with the remainder as carbohydrates around 5-20% of total calories
- Based on the exchange system or food can be weighed on a gram scale
- Milk is allowed with this diet – typically used to mix with MCT oil
- Great for oral feeders that do not have any GI complications
- Increase in MCT oil should be introduced gradually to avoid GI upset
- Urine ketones and Betahydroxy (BOH) butyrate therapeutic ranges will differ slightly from ketogenic diet

### Modified Atkins Diet
- Diet can generally be started in an outpatient setting
- Household measures used rather than a gram scale
- Focuses on counting carbohydrates 10-20 grams/day based on age and tolerance
- Fiber grams can be subtracted from the carbohydrate grams, but carbohydrates from sugar alcohols are counted (or not allowed at all)
- Fats are added to all foods at meals and snacks
- Internet-based apps are available to count carbohydrate intake
- Diet is individualized through follow up on patient compliance, seizure response and blood work

---

<!-- Page 246 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook
243

- Low Glycemic Index Diet
- Initiation takes place at home
- Diet is not meant to induce ketosis
- Foods consumed must be 50 or less on the glycemic index scale and combined with fat

- Diet Supplements
- Diet therapies for seizure control are inadequate in many vitamins and minerals including vitamin D, calcium, phosphorous, iron, magnesium, zinc
- Use ketodietcalculator.org to determine the best combination and dosages
- General supplements needed:
- Multivitamin with minerals (i.e. Flintstones® Complete or adult tablet)
- Calcium tablet or powder
- Phosphorus (i.e. KPhos neutral, which requires a prescription)
- Magnesium (i.e. Milk of Magnesium or magnesium tablet)
- Vitamin D
- There are also complete products designed for the ketogenic diet, but they can be expensive and may not be covered by insurance (i.e. Nano VM®, FruitiVits®)

KETO - Initial Education Needs
- Strict adherence to diet is necessary for success
- Recipe creation or use of KetoDietCalculator.org
- Sick day procedures and emergency room visits
- How to check urine ketones
- Use of gram scale and measuring food items or formula recipe

KETO - Medications

- General Medications
- Medications must be converted by the physician to the lowest carbohydrate content products
- In general, no liquid medications are allowed; use tablets or capsules
- Injections and vaccinations are carbohydrate free and allowed
- All breathing treatments, eye drops, ear drops, nose sprays and topical medications are allowed
- Steroids will cause a drop in ketosis; do not adjust the diet for short term treatment
- Ketodietcalculator.org has carbohydrate content of most common medications/supplements

- Body Care Products
- Carbohydrates in body care products can be absorbed through the skin and affect ketosis
- No precautions are necessary for laundry detergent or the parents' personal body care products

---

<!-- Page 247 -->

- Topical products used in small amounts are generally safe
- A list of carbohydrate free body care items is provided on the Charlie Foundation website and updated yearly

## KETO - Labs

### Electrolytes

- Check 1-2 times per day during ketogenic initiation to monitor for acidosis
- CO2 should be in normal range (&gt;20 mmol/L)
- Check electrolytes, carbon dioxide (CO2), and Betahydroxy (BOH) butyrate 3-5 days post initial hospital discharge

### Glucose

- Check every 4-12 hours during ketogenic initiation based on MD discretion
- Therapeutic goal is 50-80 mg/dL
- If 40 mg/dL or lower:
- If not NPO, treat with 15 mL apple juice
- If NPO, use 40 mL D5%W
- If greater than 80 mg/dL, consider possible illness, use of unapproved body care product, unapproved medication or non-compliance with diet

### Betahydroxy (BOH) Butyrate

- Check every morning during initiation
- Therapeutic range is 2-6 mmol/L for ketogenic diet
- Levels can decrease with illness, steroid or antibiotic therapy

### Ketones

- Check urine ketones every void in hospital and 1-2 times per day at home; frequency of monitoring at home will decrease after first follow up visit
- Therapeutic urine ketone goal is 80-160 mg/dL although levels can be unpredictable at times
- Seizure control is a better marker for diet efficacy and not ketone levels alone
- Urine ketone levels can decrease with illness, excessive hydration, steroid or antibiotic therapy

### Annual Labs (once established on diet)

- Complete metabolic panel, complete blood count, BOH, fasting lipid panel, vitamin D 25 hydroxy, pre albumin, selenium, free and total carnitine, magnesium, phosphorous, zinc

# Obesity - Treatment Phases

## Phase 1 - Intensive Health Behavior and Lifestyle Treatment (IHBLT)

- Registered dietitians, in partnership with a multidisciplinary treatment team, delivers family-based education using motivational interviewing skills
- IHBLT should start immediately upon identification of adolescent with overweight or obesity; refer to the "Obesity Education Needs" section
- Continued treatment across 3-12 months with ideally &gt;26 contact hours
- If applicable, initiate phases 2 and/or 3 immediately upon identification

## Phase 2 - Pharmacotherapy

- Continued IHBLT with a registered dietitian - see phase 1
- Adolescents ≥12 years old with obesity should be offered weight loss pharmacotherapy
- Provider to review indications, risks, and benefits of medication
- Metformin: if using for medical reasons (i.e. PCOS or diabetes), may help weight status
- Orlistat: intestinal lipase inhibitor that blocks fat absorption, may cause steatorrhea and flatulence
- Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (i.e. liraglutide): slows gastric emptying to promote satiety
- Phentermine and topiramate: appetite suppressant
- ADHD medication (i.e. lisdexamfetamine): side effect of appetite suppressant

## Phase 3 - Bariatric Surgery

- Continued IHBLT with a registered dietitian - see phase 1
- Adolescents ≥13 years old with obesity should be referred for evaluation for bariatric surgery
- Provider to review indications, risks, and benefits of surgery

## Criteria for Pediatric Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery

- Class 2 Obesity
- Criteria for comorbid conditions: clinically significant disease; examples include but are not limited to T2DM, IIH, NASH, Blount disease, SCFE, GERD, obstructive sleep apnea (AHI &gt;5), cardiovascular disease risks (HTN, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance), depressed health-related quality of life

Chapter 22 PREMATURITY

## Prematurity – General Information

- Viability (capable of life outside the uterus)
- Begins at 22 weeks gestation

- Gestation Weeks
- Preterm: &lt;37 weeks gestation
- Term: 37-42 weeks gestation
- Post Term: &gt;42 weeks gestation

- Gestational Size at Birth Classifications
- The Olsen Growth Chart is preferred for classification of the following:
- Small for Gestational Age (SGA): &lt;10th percentile birthweight
- Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA): 10-90th percentile birthweight
- Large for Gestational Age (LGA): &gt;90th percentile birthweight
- Intrauterine Growth Restricted (IUGR): fetus did not achieve normal predicted growth in utero

- Birth Weight Classifications
- Low Birth Weight (LBW): &lt;2500 g at birth
- Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW): &lt;1500 g at birth
- Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW): &lt;1000 g at birth

- Age Terminology
- Gestational Age: time from the last menstrual period to the date of birth (i.e. 32 1/7 weeks)
- Chronological Age: time elapsed after birth (typically reported in days) (i.e. 23 days old)
- Post Menstrual Age (PMA): gestational age + chronological age (typically reported in weeks) (i.e. 16 day old infant, born at 32 1/7 weeks has a post menstrual age of 34 3/7 weeks)
- Corrected Gestational Age (CGA): chronological age-the number of weeks born before 40 weeks gestation (i.e. 9 month old infant, born at 28 weeks gestation has a corrected age of 6 months)

- Growth Charts
- Fenton Growth Charts: for premature infants that are 22-50 weeks gestation; based on data from US and Western countries; the curve was smoothed in 2013 to ease growth chart transitions
- Olsen Growth Chart: for premature infants that are 23-41 weeks gestation, based on US data; BMI curves were developed in 2015 that can be useful to trend proportionality
- World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Charts: appropriate for premature infants once they are 42-44 weeks PMA and using CGA for plotting
- LBW, VLBW, and Intrauterine Growth Charts: not recommended for use as standard tool

Prematurity – Growth Goals

[tbl-30.html](tbl-30.html)

a Regain birth weight by day of life 10-14, regardless of postmenstrual age; expected weight loss in the first week of life ranges from 10-15% with greater loss found in smaller, premature infants
b Utilizing “expected weekly increase to maintain current percentile” calculations from PediTools.org may be useful in creating individualized weekly goals for infants
c Head circumference may decrease by 0.5 cm during the first week of life as extracellular fluid space contracts
d Refer to the anthropometrics chapter

## Prematurity Nutrient Needs

- Fortified breast milk or preterm infant formula will generally be adequate in nutrients when fed at the volume required to meet energy needs
- The point at which preterm infants no longer require additional nutrients for growth and development has not been clearly defined but is typically required past the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission
- Monitor growth and labs closely and adjust intake as indicated
- Refer to the parenteral nutrition (PN) chapter for prematurity PN needs

[tbl-31.html](tbl-31.html)

---

<!-- Page 253 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

[tbl-32.html](tbl-32.html)

## Prematurity - Parenteral Nutrition (PN) Considerations

- Refer to the PN chapter for additional information

### Macronutrients

- Hyperglycemic infants in the first days of life may require a lower starting Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) of 3-6 mg/kg/minute in PN
- Parenteral amino acids can be safely initiated at 1.5-2.5 g/kg/day immediately following birth, with advancement to goal within the next 1-2 days
- EFA needs can be met with 0.5-1 g/kg/day Intralipid® (8-10% total calories) or 2.2 g/kg/day SMOFlipid®

### Micronutrients and Additives

- Serum magnesium after birth may be elevated for patients whose mother received magnesium sulfate prior to delivery - provide Mg for levels &lt;3 mg/dL
- Ca:Phos molar ratio of 1.3-1.5:1 is recommended in PN; see osteopenia section of this chapter

250

---

<!-- Page 254 -->

- L-Carnitine is routinely added at 20 mg/kg/day to aid in lipid metabolism, may increase up to 40 mg/kg/day for elevated triglycerides

## Trace Elements

- Copper - monitor levels every 4 weeks for cholestatic infants on prolonged TPN and reduce parenteral copper dosing by 50% only if level is elevated; copper is a positive acute phase reactant and may be falsely elevated with inflammation; check with a C-Reactive Protein level
- Zinc-for infants born &lt;33 weeks gestation or birth weight &lt;1500 g, provide parenteral zinc of 500 mcg/kg/day; for zinc deficiency (serum zinc &lt;74 mcg/dL), provide parenteral zinc of 650 mcg/kg/day

## Prematurity - Breast milk and Formula Options

### Breast Milk

- The needs of premature infants exceed the amounts in breast milk for protein, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and some vitamins
- Maternal breast milk or donor breast milk have been shown to reduce the risk of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) because of its immune properties
- Premature material breast milk contains higher protein than term milk for 3-4 weeks after birth
- Breast milk can improve neurodevelopmental and reduce risk for chronic lung disease or sepsis

### Donor Breast Milk

- If maternal breast milk is insufficient or unavailable, utilize donor breast milk from a milk bank for infants with either a birth weight &lt;1500 g or born &lt;32 weeks gestation
- Consider transitioning off donor breast milk at 34 weeks post-menstrual age

### Human Milk Fortifier (HMF) Hydrolyzed Protein Concentrated Liquid

- Provides the nutrients inadequate in breast milk for the premature infant
- Extensive hydrolyzed protein for easy digestion and absorption
- Designed for preterm or low-birth-weight infants, up to a current weight of 3600 g per manufacturer, or as medically appropriate
- Maximum recommended concentration with breast milk is 24 kcal/oz (4 kcal/oz HMF)
- If &gt;24 kcal/oz needed for adequate growth:
- Add HMF to get to 24 kcal/oz, then add premature discharge/ transitional formula powder to provide additional calories up to 30 kcal/oz
- Use liquid protein for additional calories or oil for an additional 2 kcal/oz
- Example: Similac® HMF Hydrolyzed Protein Concentrated Liquid

### Premature Formula

- Typically used for infants with birth weight &lt;1800 g, up to a current weight of 2500 g (Enfamil® Premature) or 3600 g (Similac® Special Care), or as medically appropriate

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook
251

---

<!-- Page 255 -->

- Not commercially available for purchase (patients generally not sent home on these)
- As appropriate, transition to premature discharge/transitional formula -1 week before discharge
- Examples: Similac® Special Care®, Enfamil® Premature

- Premature Discharge/Transitional Formula
- Contains increased protein, iron, calcium, phosphorus, calories (standard of 22 kcal/oz)
- Typically used for infants with birth weight 1800-2500 g
- No clear recommendations available for duration of use; generally used to a corrected age of 9-12 months (younger/smaller infants may need it the longest)
- Texas WIC Guidelines for providing premature discharge/transitional formula (updated October 2022): preterm infants (regardless of birth weight) and term IUGR infants (&lt;2500 g birth weight, regardless of gestation), may receive the formula until 12 months chronological age
- Examples: Similac® Neosure®, Enfamil® EnfaCare®

- Hydrolyzed Protein Formula
- Used for concern for milk protein allergy, GI intolerance or malabsorption
- May need additional calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D supplement with prematurity
- Examples: Similac® Alimentum®, Nutramigen®, Pregestimil®, Gerber® Good Start® Extensive HA

- Amino Acid/Elemental Formula
- Used for short bowel syndrome if breast milk not available or if patient does not tolerate hydrolyzed protein formula
- May need additional calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D supplement with prematurity
- Examples: Elecare® Infant, Neocate® Infant, Alfamino® Infant, PurAmino™ Infant

- Soy Formula
- Not recommended for premature infants &lt;1800 g weight
- Phytic acid binds with calcium which may lead to osteopenia
- Bioavailability of protein is lower and shown to cause poor growth
- Examples: Similac® Soy Isomil®, Enfamil® ProSobee®

- Liquid Protein Additive
- Extensively hydrolyzed liquid protein to be used with human milk or infant formula
- Allows specific modification of protein intake for preterm infant feedings
- 6 mL liquid protein = 1 g protein
- Examples: Liquid Protein Fortifier by Abbott

---

<!-- Page 256 -->

- Anti Reflux Formula
- Term formulas containing rice starch to reduce spit-up
- Not recommended for premature infants as it does not meet protein or mineral needs
- Cannot concentrate above 24 kcal/oz due to viscosity of liquid, making it impractical for use in many infants who are volume restricted or with elevated energy needs
- Examples: Similac® for Spit Up, Enfamil AR™

Prematurity – Feeding Considerations

- Booster Feeding
- A method of optimizing breast milk intake in the preterm infant, while supplementing some full formula feedings to promote improved weight gain, linear growth and bone development by better meeting kcal, protein and mineral needs
- One common method is to allow 4 feeds per day of breastfeeding + 4 feeds of full transitional formula to improve protein and mineral intake
- Close outpatient follow-up of growth and nutrient intake is recommended upon discharge

- Infant Driven Feeding
- In general, attempts to feed orally typically begin around 34 weeks CGA
- Infant driven feeding is when oral feeds are provided in response to in the infant’s behavioral cues (physiologic stability, behavioral and motor regulation, and hunger cues)
- Infant driven feeding should be considered if the patient is medically stable (i.e. respiratory rate of &lt;70 breaths/minute on ≤2L oxygen; gastric bolus feeds tolerance over ≤30 minutes)
- Pureed and solid foods are offered orally based on development; assess at 4-6 months CGA

Prematurity-Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)
- Infants may have increased nutrient needs 120-150 kcal/kg/day enterally due to increased respiratory effort and increased stress
- Provide adequate protein
- Typically fluid restricted 120-150 ml/kg/day
- Monitor use of diuretics and effects on bone mineral metabolism

Prematurity-Iron Deficiency Anemia

- Risk Factors
- Premature birth (as most iron accumulation occurs during last trimester of pregnancy)
- Intrauterine growth restriction
- Maternal issues during pregnancy (anemia, hypertension, diabetes)
- Frequent blood sampling (i.e. serum labs) of the infant

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

## Prevention and Treatment

- Initiate iron supplementation between 2-6 weeks of age
- All preterm infants should receive at least 2 mg/kg/day until 12 months of age
- Infants receiving erythropoietin and those with significant blood losses may need up to 6 mg/kg/day initially (prolonged intake &gt;3 mg/kg/day or use with frequent transfusions should be avoided due to adverse effects)
- Iron is not routinely added to PN solutions for preterm infants

## Prematurity – Gastrointestinal Disorders

### Gastroschisis

- An abdominal wall defect with no present sac; prognosis depends on bowel condition
- Provide TPN until infant is surgically repaired and tolerating enteral feeds
- Advance to goal slowly (can take weeks to months)

### Omphalocele

- An abdominal wall defect with sac present
- Often associated with other syndromes, which determines prognosis
- Begin feeds or TPN per care team; ability to feed enterally prior to repair, as surgery is not urgent

### Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC)

- May present as abdominal distention, bloody stool, emesis, worsening of respiratory function
- Infant will be NPO for a period; staged for severity
- TPN will provide nutrition during NPO period
- When medically cleared, enteral feeds will be restarted at trophic rate without fortification and advanced slowly; may require breast milk or elemental formula

### Reflux (GER and GERD)

- More common in preterm infants due to intestinal immaturity
- Some treatment strategies include smaller, more frequent feedings, prone and left lateral positioning, post-pyloric feeding, extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid/elemental formula, thickened feedings, medications (i.e. anti-reflux) and surgery (i.e. fundoplication)
- Each treatment option has risks for preterm infants that should be carefully weighed with the benefits among the multi-disciplinary team; in most cases, symptoms improve with age

## Prematurity-Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome

- May require increased calories initially due to distress with withdrawal symptoms
- Monitor closely for infants exposed to drugs in utero or weaning from medications used inpatient
- Excessive sucking and hyperphagia are common coping mechanisms in these infants; may need to limit oral volumes if excessive intake is thought to contribute to worsened emesis or discomfort
- Maternal breast milk is preferred for mothers who are in treatment, but is not recommended for mothers who are using illicit drugs or alcohol; HIV-positive mothers can provide EBM if their viral load is low
- Consider partially hydrolyzed or lactose free formula if emesis and/or diarrhea

# Prematurity-Osteopenia

## Risk Factors

- &lt;34 weeks gestation (increased risk for &lt;27 weeks gestation), birth weight &lt;1500 g, prolonged parenteral nutrition (i.e. &gt;4 weeks)
- Receiving medications that increase mineral excretion (i.e. diuretic (especially furosemide), and steroids (including dexamethasone))
- History of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
- Failure to tolerate formula or fortifiers with increased mineral content

## Identification

- Biochemical tests (serum labs) of osteopenia are not definitive but may be helpful
- Consider x-ray (i.e. wrist, ankle) to evaluate for bone demineralization, fracture or rickets
- Begin monitoring at 4-5 weeks after birth and re-check minimum monthly
- Phosphorus
- May be normal or low (important to trend values)
- Typically not a good indicator of osteopenia, but &lt;4 mg/dL is a potential indicator
- Calcium
- May be low, normal or high (important to trend values)
- Typically not a good indicator
- Alkaline Phosphatase
- May be slightly elevated during periods of growth (300-400 units/L)
- May be elevated with hepatic dysfunction or liver disease
- &gt;800-1000 units/L is a potential indication
- Vitamin D 25 Hydroxy
- Storage form of vitamin D and best indicator of vitamin D status
- Typically low but may be normal if receiving supplements
- &lt;20-30 ng/mL may be sign of deficiency and increased risk
- Note: Vitamin D 1,25 OH is typically not recommended to be checked

## Prevention and Treatment

- Calcium and/or phosphorus supplementation as needed to meet minimum needs, to maintain normal values and/or to achieve optimal calcium and phosphorus ratios:
- Enteral Nutrition: 1.6:1 to 1.8:1 (mg calcium:mg phosphorus)
- Parenteral Nutrition: 1.3:1 to 1.5:1 (mMol calcium:mMol phosphorus)
- Provide calcium supplements separately from feeds (as able) and phosphorus supplements, as calcium can bind to phosphorus
- Vitamin D supplementation as needed to meet minimum needs and/or maintain normal values (goal vitamin D 25 hydroxy level of 30-80 ng/mL)

---

<!-- Page 259 -->

Pediatric Nutrition Handbook

# Prematurity-Labs

- Calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D 25-hydroxy
- Hematocrit, reticulocytes, ferritin
- Electrolytes, magnesium, direct bilirubin, triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine
- For infants with birth gestation &lt;33 weeks or birth weight &lt;1500 g, consider trending serum Zinc levels at birth, 1 month of life, and monthly afterward until 37 weeks PMA (reference range for preterm 74-146 mcg/dL; term 70-120 mcg/dL); if zinc level is low, increase supplementation and recheck in 1 month
- Obtain copper levels for cholestatic infants on prolonged TPN &gt;1 month to monitor for deficiency (reference range for preterm 30-40 mcg/dL; term 12-67 mcg/dL)
- Monitor BUN in preterm infants; if BUN &lt;10 mg/dL, infant may benefit from protein up 5 g/kg/day
