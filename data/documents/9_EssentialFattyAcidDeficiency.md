<a id='9e823416-982a-4fc0-9a61-591e2341c308'></a>

# ETIOLOGY

*   Most common cause of EFAD is the omission of ILE from PN
    *   Prescribing error
    *   Conserve product due to shortage
    *   Termed 'Fat-free PN'
*   For EN (Enteral Nutrition)
    *   Inadequate linoleic acid intake
    *   Intestinal failure with fat intolerance and/or malabsorption as with short bowel syndrome
*   Anytime the intake of linoleic acid is < 2-4% and linolenic acid is < 0.25-0.5% of energy requirements for prolonged periods (>2-4 weeks)

EFAD SYMPTOMS

*   Most noted is 'dry, scaly skin rash' known as scaly dermatitis
*   Alopecia
*   Hepatomegaly
*   Thrombocytopenia
*   Fatty liver
*   Impairment in immune function and wound healing

## MONITORING

**Assess for Symptoms at Risk:**
*   Malnutrition
*   Documented poor nutritional intake in the past month
*   Intestinal failure
    *   Fat malabsorption
        *   Short bowel syndrome
*   Fat-free PN

# MONITORING

*   Biochemical:
    *   Triene:Tetraene ratio (also known as Holman index)
        *   Value of 0.2 indicates biochemical changes
            *   May be identified in 7-10 days of Fat-free PN
        *   0.4 most often associated with symptoms
            *   Usually appear after 3 weeks of Fat-free PN
*   Prevention is recommended
    *   Provide 2-4% of energy as linoleic acid and 0.25-0.5% if energy as linolenic acid

## CONCLUSIONS

*   Patients receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition are at risk for micronutrient and essential fatty acid deficiency
*   Deficiency symptoms take time to manifest and are more likely to be caused by inadequate dosing of nutrients in nutrition support
*   Monitoring should be established to identify deficiencies early however, prevention by providing adequate doses in nutrition support is the optimal approach towards managing micronutrient and EFA deficiency

As one of the pharmacy specialist pioneers, Professor Mirtallo was
instrumental in leading cost-effective practices in parenteral nutrition and
advancing the role of the pharmacist on nutrition support services.

<a id='c5ae1921-f089-4056-a647-7399f414dd50'></a>

Professor Mirtallo has been very active in professional societies and is Past President of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). He also spent many years on the ASPEN Public Policy Committee, where he advocated for reimbursement of enteral and parenteral nutrition in the hospital and home, dealt with drug shortage issues and worked to improve the safety and efficacy of parenteral nutrition.

<a id='4ea7a1df-1efa-4327-8e7f-d4a08c0723e0'></a>

As a representative to the Joint Commission, he served on the task force that created the Nutrition Care Standards. Mr. Mirtallo has been actively involved with nutrition support guidelines. Recently, he co-authored an etiology-based definition of malnutrition which is the basis for an inter-professional malnutrition strategy. He chaired a parenteral nutrition safety summit in the fall of 2011 which led to the development of the safety consensus recommendations released by ASPEN and the American Society for Health System Pharmacists. Currently Professor Mirtallo is Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmacy Practice and Administration. He is also a Clinical Practice Specialist with ASPEN.
