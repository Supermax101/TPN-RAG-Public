# CHAPTER 1: NUTRITION AND ENTERAL FEEDING

<!-- Page 282 -->

NUTRITION AND ENTERAL FEEDING • 1/8

# PRINCIPLES

- Maternal breast milk is the preferred feed for all babies. Mothers should be counselled and supported to express milk as soon as possible after birth and frequently thereafter to ensure adequate supply for baby
- Compared to formula milk maternal colostrum and breast milk reduce rates of mortality, BPD and ROP, reduce risks of NEC and sepsis and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes
- Early enteral feeds promote normal gastrointestinal structure and function, motility and enzymatic activity
- Delayed nutrition can result in growth restriction with long-term complications of parenteral nutrition, dysbiosis of the intestine, poor organ growth and poorer neurological outcomes
- Manage feeding on an individual basis dependent upon gastrointestinal tolerance and availability of maternal breast milk
- This guideline is designed to be used in conjunction with individual clinical assessment processes when decisions are made regarding the initiation and advancement of feeds in preterm babies

# NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Daily recommended intake of nutrients for stable growing term and preterm babies

[tbl-18.html](tbl-18.html)

# FEEDING GUIDE

- Commence enteral feeds in preterm babies as close to birth as possible (unless clinically contraindicated)

## Buccal colostrum

- Provides benefits of colostrum to all sick and premature babies unable to breast feed orally as it is absorbed through buccal mucosa
- Give to all babies admitted to NNU who are not receiving oral feeds unless maternal breast milk is contraindicated (see Breastfeeding guideline)
- Place 0.3 mL (0.15 mL per side) colostrum in buccal cavity by syringe/gloved finger at 3-hrly intervals for first 48 hr of life
- Parental involvement in administration recommended. Nursing staff may teach and supervise parents to give colostrum

# ENTERAL FEEDS

## Route of administration

- Most babies &lt;34 weeks cannot co-ordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing to feed effectively and so should be fed via a naso- or orogastric tube
- Some babies &lt;34 weeks may show feeding cues, especially while in skin-to-skin. They may be offered the breast, but bottle feeds should not be offered until &gt;34 weeks

# Initiating and advancing enteral feeds

Make every effort to use mother's fresh expressed colostrum and breast milk

![img-11.jpeg](images/page0352_img-11.jpg)

- If maternal expressed breast milk (MEBM) not available within 48 hr of birth, use donor expressed breast milk (DEBM), if criteria met, or preterm formula (See Breastfeeding guideline)
- If unable to advance enteral feeds over several days:
- maintain trophic feeds small volumes (10–20 mL/kg/day) intended to stimulate gut trophic hormones but not intended to contribute to nutritional intake
- contact dietician

# PROBIOTICS

- Reduce rates of NEC, sepsis, and mortality in babies born &lt;32 weeks' gestation
- Insufficient evidence currently to recommend one product over another
- Give to all babies born &lt;32 weeks' gestation when receiving 20 mL/kg/day enteral feeds
- if baby has stoma, 50 mL/kg/day
- If enteral feeds stopped, discontinue and restart when baby receiving enteral feeds 20 mL/kg/day
- if baby has stoma, 50 mL/kg/day
- Stop when baby reaches 34 weeks' CGA
- Provide parents with WMNODN leaflet on potential benefits and risks of probiotic administration

# WHICH MILK TO USE

## MEBM

- Remains the ideal milk for term and preterm babies
- Support mothers to initiate and maintain expressing (see Breastfeeding guideline)
- Wherever possible, use MEBM for initiation of enteral feeds. If milk supply insufficient for requirements it may not always be possible to follow feeding schedules until sufficient breast milk is available
- record absence of MEBM as 'no maternal milk available' (NMMA)
- if insufficient MEBM at 48 hr of life, use alternative feeds

## DEBM

- If insufficient MEBM, DEBM is next milk of choice for babies &lt;30 weeks or &lt;1000 g and/or for the short-term support of any baby on NNU whose mother is seeking to establish breast milk expression
- More protective against NEC than formula
- Consent for use must be obtained from parents
- Poor nutritional profile, so use restricted to establishing feeds only
- Low protein content – add breast milk fortifier (BMF) to DEBM when volume reaches ≥150 mL/kg/day then advance to 180 mL/kg/day as tolerated

NUTRITION AND ENTERAL FEEDING • 3/8

- Once full volume achieved (minimum 150 mL/kg/day) and baby aged ≥14 days introduce alternative feed (see Slow change to a different type of milk feed)

## Breast milk fortifier

- Required by all babies born &lt;34 weeks or &lt;1.8 kg fed exclusively on M/DEBM to meet protein and micronutrient requirements for growth
- Add BMF when M/DEBM volumes reach 150 mL/kg/day
- Increase volume of M/DEBM + BMF to maintenance full feeds of 180 mL/kg/day
- Use at full strength in M/DEBM

[tbl-19.html](tbl-19.html)

- Prepare as per manufacturer's instructions:
- swirl breast milk gently to dissolve BMF to protect fragile cellular components in breast milk
- Feed immediately or store in fridge and use within 12 hr
- If baby receiving &gt;50% requirements as preterm formula, stop BMF – unless advised to continue by neonatal dietitian

Composition of mother's own breast milk, and fortified breast milk/100 mL

[tbl-20.html](tbl-20.html)

To administer BMF if baby fully breast fed

[tbl-21.html](tbl-21.html)

- Stop BMF at term (40 weeks) unless:
- discharged &lt;term and/or &lt;1.8 kg
- establishing oral breast feeding
- showing slow growth velocity
- See http://swmnodn.org.uk/guidelines/home-fortifier-instructionsv3final/ for guidance on use post discharge
- All babies should be weaned off fortified breast milk supplements by 6 weeks post-term or 3.5 kg body weight, whichever is soonest

## Protein supplement (Nutriprem protein supplement)

- Use only under direction of neonatal/paediatric dietitian
- Provides extra protein to meet requirements of babies &lt;1000 g
- Indicated if energy and protein intake are below requirements
- Extensively hydrolysed protein alone - NO micronutrients or energy

Issue 9

Issued: August 2022

Expires: August 2024

<!-- Page 285 -->

NUTRITION AND ENTERAL FEEDING • 4/8

- Add to M/DEBM alongside BMF or direct to preterm formula
- 1 g sachet = 0.82 g protein
- If blood urea in normal range do not add protein supplement discuss with neonatal/paediatric dietitian
- Monitor blood urea twice weekly in all babies on protein supplement
- Stop protein supplement when urea level &gt;6 or when baby reaches 1000 g

## Preterm milk formula

- Nutriprem 1/SMA Gold Prem 1: formulated to meet the nutrient needs of preterm babies born &lt;34 weeks and &lt;2 kg where insufficient MEBM to meet requirements
- Nutriprem 2/SMA Gold Prem 2: nutrient enriched post-discharge formula (NEPDF) formulated to meet the ongoing enhanced nutrient needs of babies born &lt;34 weeks, once they reach 37 weeks’ CGA/at discharge from NNU
- Babies with normal growth velocity and no requirement for catch-up growth may be discharged on term formula with vitamin and mineral supplementation
- NEPDF especially useful for babies who have higher nutritional requirements (e.g. CLD on oxygen) or babies who have ongoing poor growth (e.g. have crossed down &gt;2 centiles on growth chart during neonatal stay)
- Volumes &gt;180 mL/kg are not usually necessary and other reasons for poor growth should be sought before further volume increases introduced (see Inadequate growth)

## Specialised preterm formula (Hydrolysed Nutriprem 1)

- Always use under direction of paediatric/neonatal dietitian
- Hydrolysed Nutriprem 1 – extensively hydrolysed protein preterm formula
- may be suitable for babies who fail to tolerate/progress on standard preterm formula or have a family history of CMPI (NOTE contains lactose)

## Composition of preterm formula/100 mL

[tbl-22.html](tbl-22.html)

## All 'specialised' term formulas

- Do not provide adequate nutrition for preterm babies at standard dilution so require modification to ensure nutritional requirements met. Use only when clinically indicated and always under direction of paediatric/neonatal dietitian

## FEED TOLERANCE EVALUATION

Monitoring of feed tolerance, growth and biochemical balance is critical in nutritional management of preterm babies to ensure optimal outcomes

### Feed tolerance

- Poor gut motility is common among VLBW/ELBW babies, and some will have episodes requiring temporary discontinuation of feeding or delay in advancing feeds
- If failure to progress feeds continues over several days, seek advice early from neonatal/paediatric dietitian

### Assessment of gastric residuals (GR)

- Evaluate feed tolerance 4-hrly (see flowchart below)
- Routine aspiration of GR not recommended in preterm babies
- Do not use GR volumes in isolation when deciding to limit advancement of feeds

![img-15.jpeg](images/page0361_img-15.jpg)

### Anthropometry

- See Growth monitoring guideline

### Biochemical monitoring

- Measure plasma urea, electrolytes, calcium, and phosphate weekly in stable preterm babies
- Monitor glucose closely in initial few days

# INADEQUATE GROWTH VELOCITY

- Preterm babies with weight gain &lt;16 g/kg/day require further assessment
- Review proportional growth (weight, head, length) on age and gender appropriate growth chart
- Ensure baby prescribed and receiving recommended nutritional intake. Ensure on maximum advised volume of age/weight appropriate feed – see maintenance feed volume/type charts
- Review energy and protein intake per kg/day against ESPGHAN recommendations for weight/gestational age
- Measure urine sodium concentration. Value &lt;20 mmol/L indicates sodium depletion (not valid if baby on diuretics)
- If sodium supplements required:
- check urine sodium weekly
- keep total enteral sodium intake (feed + standard supplement + prescribed supplement) &lt; 8 mmol/kg/day
- In babies receiving MEBM use hind milk (see Breast milk expression guideline)
- Refer to neonatal/paediatric dietitian for assessment and advice
- Do not advance feed volumes beyond that recommended unless on advice of dietitian
- Formula fed &gt;37 weeks, ≥2 kg:
- replace 25–50% MEBM/NEPDF with high energy term formula (Infatrini, SMA® High Energy, Similac® High Energy) and refer to paediatric/neonatal dietitian for follow-up
- Breast milk fed &gt;37 weeks:
- stop any BMF in MEBM but continue with concentrated BMF supplements as detailed in Breast milk fortifier section

Department of Health Guidelines state all children aged 6 months–5 yr receive vitamin supplementation containing vitamins A C D unless receiving formula milk &gt;500 mL/day
Exclusively breastfed babies should receive vitamin D supplementation from birth

# CHAPTER 2: PARENTERAL NUTRITION

PARENTERAL NUTRITION • 1/4

# DEFINITION

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is the IV infusion of nutrients for the purpose of tissue maintenance, metabolic requirements and growth promotion in babies unable to tolerate full enteral feeds

Seek advice from your local PN pharmacist or local nutrition team

# INDICATIONS FOR PN

- Newborn babies – commence PN if:
- &lt;31+0 weeks’ gestation
- ≥31+0 weeks’ gestation – if sufficient progress not made with enteral feeding in first 72 hr after birth
- unlikely to establish sufficient enteral feeding, e.g. babies with congenital gut disorder or critical illness (e.g. sepsis)
- Babies who have previously established some enteral feeds, commence PN if:
- enteral feeds stopped and unlikely to be restarted within 48 hr
- enteral feeds stopped for &gt;24 hr and unlikely to be sufficient progress with enteral feeding within further 48 hr
- Commence PN as soon as decision made baby meets criteria (within 8 hr of decision at latest)

# MODE OF DELIVERY

- Administer PN continuously over 24 hr

## Peripheral PN

- PN should be ideally delivered centrally (high glucose and electrolyte concentrations result in a high osmolarity – limiting nutrition given peripherally)
- Depending on aqueous feed e.g. Vamin® composition, local policy may permit peripheral administration of certain products in certain circumstances – check local policy before prescribing
- Running lipid peripherally in addition to aqueous phase may prolong the life of the peripheral cannula

## Central PN

- Requires placement of a central catheter [see Long line insertion (peripherally sited) guideline] with tip in either superior vena cava or inferior vena cava
- Infuse PN via a dedicated lumen
- continuous vancomycin/sodium/potassium chloride infusion may be administered simultaneously with PN, providing maximum total concentration ≤200 mmol/L
- If access difficult, discuss PN drug compatibilities with pharmacist
- Shield syringes, bags and infusion sets from light

Never administer calcium, magnesium and phosphate containing fluid simultaneously with PN

Central PN [long lines and umbilical venous catheters (UVC)] can introduce infection and septicaemia

# CONSTITUTION OF PN

- For practical and safety reasons standard bags are preferred as neonatal nutritional requirements are largely predictable (see Nutrition and enteral feeding guideline)

Additions to PN to be made within an aseptic pharmacy only

- If required, additional electrolytes can be infused alongside PN (see Central PN)

## Volume

- PN provided primarily for nutrition
- although fluid and nutrition are closely linked and volume needs to be considered carefully, the concepts are not interchangeable e.g. providing 150 mL/kg/day fluid does not guarantee provision of adequate nutrition
- may be beneficial to give concentrated aqueous phase solutions to enable administration of additional drugs without compromising nutritional intake
- 30–40 mL/kg/day feed to be established before commencing weaning of PN

PARENTERAL NUTRITION • 2/4

## Protein/amino acid
- Initial PN bag to contain 1.5–2 g/kg/day
- Target protein intake, by day 5 of life, (regardless when PN was commenced):
- preterm babies: 3–4 g/kg/day
- term babies: 3 g/kg/day
- Administer sufficient carbohydrate to facilitate the accretion of protein (approximately 25 kcal/g protein)

## Glucose
- 6–9 g/kg/day in first 24 hr – take PN and additional fluids into consideration
- Increase glucose intake as tolerated to optimise calorie intake to maximum of 9–16 g/kg/day
- If severe or persistent hyperglycaemia develops, commence insulin infusion – see Administration of Actrapid® insulin (soluble insulin) in Hyperglycaemia guideline

## Electrolytes
- Sodium: ≥3 mmol/kg/day in preterm babies who have commenced natriuresis
- Potassium: ≥2 mmol/kg/day from day 2–3
- Babies given electrolytes solely as chloride salts can develop hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis (consider adding acetate to PN, where available)
- Monitor serum phosphate twice weekly; aim to maintain at around 2 mmol/L

## Micronutrients
- Calcium: 0.8–1 mmol/kg/day first 48 hr of life, increased to 2 mmol/kg/day thereafter
- Phosphate: 1 mmol/kg/day first 48 hr of life, increased to 2 mmol/kg/day
- monitor phosphate – higher doses may be required
- if possible, use organic phosphate compounds
- Magnesium: 0.18–0.2 mmol/L

## Trace elements

### Peditrace®
- Addition of trace element admixture (Peditrace®) shortens the shelf-life of standard bags to 7 days
- Zinc and selenium will be contained within standard aqueous feed bags
- If baby on short-term PN and receiving some milk feeds, trace elements may not be required
- If baby on PN &gt;2 weeks with enteral feed intake of &lt;50% and not receiving Peditrace®, discuss with PN pharmacist/dietitian

## Fat
- 2 lipid emulsions used routinely on NNU: Intralipid® (soya bean origin) and SMOF lipid (blend of soya bean, MCT fat, olive oil and fish oils)
- Consider SMOF lipid for babies with conjugated bilirubin &gt;50
- Commence lipid 1–2 g/kg/day IV when commencing aqueous phase
- increase by 0.5–1 g/kg/day to maximum 3–4 g/kg/day
- all lipid to be infused over 24 hr

## Vitamins
- Vitlipid (fat soluble vits) + Solivito (water soluble vits) are added to lipid syringes (Lipid bags do not contain vitamins)
- Should be given within 48 hr of starting PN

# MONITORING

[tbl-3.html](tbl-3.html)

# COMPLICATIONS

Catheter-related: [see Long line insertion (peripherally sited) guideline]
- Peripheral catheters: extravasations and skin sloughs
- Septicaemia

## Electrolyte abnormalities
- Electrolyte and acid-base disturbances

## Metabolic
- Hyper/hypoglycaemia, osmotic diuresis
- Metabolic bone disease: mineral abnormalities (Ca/PO<sub>4</sub>/Mg)
- Hyperlipidaemia and hypercholesterolaemia
- Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia

## PN-associated cholestatic hepatitis (see Liver dysfunction in preterm babies guideline)
- Can occur with prolonged PN (&gt;10–14 days)
- probably due to combination of PN hepato-toxicity, sepsis and reduced oral feeding
- often transient
- usually manifests as rising serum bilirubin (with increased conjugated component &gt;50 micromol/L) and mildly elevated transaminases
- leads to deficiencies of fatty acids and trace minerals in enterally fed babies
- even small enteral feeds will limit or prevent this problem and therefore trophic feeds (10-20ml/kg/d) should be given to all babies on PN unless there are contraindications such as acute clinical instability or NEC
- consider other causes of hyperbilirubinaemia (PN-induced cholestasis is diagnosis of exclusion) e.g. CMV, hypothyroidism
- if failure to progress with enteral feeding in a timely fashion, seek advice from unit nutrition team, neonatal dietitian or paediatric gastroenterologist

# WEANING PN
- Commence enteral feeds as soon as possible
- see Nutrition and enteral feeding guideline for initiating and advancing enteral feeds
- Do not wean PN until total volume of 180 mL/kg/day reached (unless fluid restricted) i.e. this includes &gt;30 mL/kg/day enteral feed
- When advancing enteral feedings, proportionally reduce rate of PN administration to achieve desired total fluid volume

<!-- Page 308 -->

PARENTERAL NUTRITION • 4/4

- When weaning PN decrease aqueous and lipid simultaneously in proportion to ensure correct ratio of calorie distribution by fat and carbohydrate.
- Ratio dependent on total volume of aqueous phase + lipid, e.g. if increasing feed by 1 mL, decrease aqueous phase by 1 × (aqueous phase mL/hr/aqueous phase ml/hr + lipid mL/hr), and decrease lipid by 1 × (lipid mL/hr/aqueous phase ml/hr + lipid mL)
- Assess nutrient intake from both PN and enteral feed in relation to overall nutrition goals
- If enteral vitamins required, commence when lipid syringe infusion &lt;10 mL/kg/day
- For babies born &lt;28 weeks, stop PN within 24 hr of tolerating 140–150 mL/kg/day of enteral feeds and fortify the milk if appropriate (see Nutrition and external feeding guideline)
- For babies born ≥28 weeks, stop PN within 24 hr of tolerating 120–140 mL/kg/day of enteral feeds and consider fortification if appropriate (see Nutrition and enteral feeding guideline)
