# KB Manifests

These manifests define *explicit* document sets used for benchmarking.

Why:
- Benchmark claims (especially "RAG lift") are not credible without a frozen KB definition.
- Question-bank / study-guide documents can contaminate holdout evaluation if included.

Files:
- `kb_clean.json`: paper-main KB (leakage-safe)
- `kb_max.json`: appendix-only KB (max coverage)
