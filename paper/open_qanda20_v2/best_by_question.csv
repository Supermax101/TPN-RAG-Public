- Repeat BMP/CO2; consider acetate-containing fluids/PN adjustment for CO₂ 14 mEq/L
- Add K only after trending down and adequate urine output continues."
open_11,"Case context:
In the past 48 hours, BGJ has received an increase in her enteral nutrition, which consists of mother’s breast milk (MBM) with a backup of donor breast milk (DBM). Her umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) and umbilical venous catheter (UVC) have been removed, and a single-lumen peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line has been placed in her right upper extremity. The tip of the PICC has been confirmed as central by x-ray. BGJ has been receiving the initial parenteral nutrition (PN) prescription that was written two days ago, and repeat laboratory tests were conducted this morning.
A PICC line was placed in the right upper extremity after the removal of the UAC and UVC. BGJ continues to receive caffeine, but her antibiotics were discontinued after her initial blood culture remained negative at 36 hours. There have been no changes in her IV fluids. She began receiving breast milk at 1 ml every 3 hours, and today this will be advanced to 1.5 ml every 3 hours.
Her current weight is 0.510 kg.
Over the past 24 hours, BGJ’s total fluid intake was 54.1 ml. She has not taken any oral feeds. Her orogastric/nasogastric intake was 8 ml, given as 1 ml every 3 hours. Her intravenous intake totaled 46.1 ml, which consisted of 40.8 ml of PN and 5.3 ml of ILE.
Her total output was 23 ml plus one stool. This included 20 ml of urine and 3 ml from the NG/G-tube. There were no drains, no ostomy output, and stool was passed once.
On abdominal examination, her abdomen was round and soft with positive bowel sounds.
Her most recent laboratory results are as follows:
Sodium: 128 mEq/L
Potassium: 4.7 mEq/L
Chloride: 100 mEq/L
Carbon dioxide: 24 mEq/L
Glucose: 115 mg/dl
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 37 mg/dl

Phosphorus: 5.1 mg/dl
Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dl
Triglycerides (TGs): 187 mg/dl
Total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dl
Albumin: 2.8 g/dl

Question:
What follow-up laboratory test results might be important to obtain for the following day?","BGJ should have a repeat laboratory panel (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, SCr, glucose, calcium, albumin, and phosphorus) in 2 days to allow time for the changes in the PN solution to be reflected in BGJ’s laboratory test results and to be mindful of BGJ’s limited blood volume.

open_12,"Case context:
Patient Clinical Information:
During the past week, BGJ’s enteral nutrition has been advanced, and she is currently receiving mother’s breast milk and donor breast milk at 5 ml every 3 hours, primarily donor breast milk due to a decreased supply of mother’s milk. Parenteral nutrition volume has been reduced as feeding volume advanced, and the amino acid and electrolyte content has been reduced to allow compounding into a smaller PN volume and to complement the protein and electrolytes received from the enteral feedings. Today’s laboratory test results show a low hemoglobin and hematocrit, so the plan is to transfuse BGJ with 10 ml per kilogram of packed red blood cells given in two aliquots 12 hours apart. Because of concerns about necrotizing enterocolitis following blood transfusions, the neonatologist wants to hold enteral nutrition for 24 hours after the last aliquot of packed red blood cells is received. BGJ will then begin receiving full PN. She still has her peripherally inserted central catheter in place, and peripheral venous access is initiated for the blood transfusion.
Procedures or diagnostic tests:
Laboratory panel and hemoglobin and hematocrit were drawn today to assess electrolytes and because of the requirement to track fraction of inspired oxygen on the ventilator.
Medication changes:
BGJ continues to receive caffeine for apnea of prematurity.
IV fluid changes:
BGJ is currently receiving supplemental parenteral nutrition in addition to breast milk. Refer to PN order to see current PN composition.

Yes, continue ILE at the current dose of 3 g/kg/day. The patient is receiving appropriate essential fatty acid provision, has stable clinical status, and the planned 24-hour hold on enteral nutrition necessitates adequate parenteral nutrition support including lipids. There are no contraindications to continuing ILE at this dose (triglycerides not reported as elevated, liver function not indicating intolerance, and patient is hemodynamically stable).

**Potassium**: Reduce or hold potassium initially given elevated serum level of 5.3 mEq/L. Recommend potassium phosphate 0.5 mmol/kg/day (provides 1 mEq/kg potassium) and hold additional potassium chloride and acetate until recheck.

**Calcium**: Maintain calcium gluconate at 1-1.5 mEq/kg/day (current calcium 8.7 mg/dL is acceptable).

**Phosphorus**: Maintain total phosphorus at 1-1.5 mmol/kg/day through combined sodium and potassium phosphate.

**Magnesium**: Maintain magnesium sulfate at 0.15-0.25 mEq/kg/day.

**Chloride/Acetate balance**: Adjust to maintain acid-base balance given CO2 of 21 mEq/L; favor acetate salts to provide mild alkalinization.

open_16,"Case context:
Patient Clinical Information:
During the past week, BGJ’s enteral nutrition has been advanced, and she is currently receiving mother’s breast milk and donor breast milk at 5 ml every 3 hours, primarily donor breast milk due to a decreased supply of mother’s milk. Parenteral nutrition volume has been reduced as feeding volume advanced, and the amino acid and electrolyte content has been reduced to allow compounding into a smaller PN volume and to complement the protein and electrolytes received from the enteral feedings. Today’s laboratory test results show a low hemoglobin and hematocrit, so the plan is to transfuse BGJ with 10 ml per kilogram of packed red blood cells given in two aliquots 12 hours apart. Because of concerns about necrotizing enterocolitis following blood transfusions, the neonatologist wants to hold enteral nutrition for 24 hours after the last aliquot of packed red blood cells is received. BGJ will then begin receiving full PN. She still has her peripherally inserted central catheter in place, and peripheral venous access is initiated for the blood transfusion.
Procedures or diagnostic tests:
Laboratory panel and hemoglobin and hematocrit were drawn today to assess electrolytes and because of the requirement to track fraction of inspired oxygen on the ventilator.
Medication changes:

- Reassess the plan to hold enteral feeds for 24 hours post-transfusion; if feeds must be held, restart as trophic feeds (10–20 mL/kg/day) as soon as clinically allowed rather than remaining completely NPO longer than necessary.
- Increase sodium provision in PN and/or provide supplemental sodium to address hyponatremia (Na 128 mEq/L), while continuing close daily electrolyte monitoring and evaluating fluid balance/renal losses.
- Lactation intervention now: consult Lactation Services and implement a structured pumping/support plan to improve mother’s milk supply; continue donor human milk as needed.
- While on full PN: ensure PN provides adequate total fluid/energy/protein for growth and adjust electrolytes (including Ca/Phos balance) based on daily labs and trends."

Question:
What follow-up laboratory test results might be important to obtain for the following morning?","The usefulness of repeating laboratory tests in BGJ could be hotly debated, given her limited blood volume and the most likely reason for her anemia being laboratory monitoring. Because the plan is to reinitiate MBM/DBM at 5 ml every 3 hours at 24 hours after her last blood transfusion and advance to the goal EN volume thereafter, the need for further laboratory monitoring may not be warranted. Given BGJ’s low sodium, the recommendation is to repeat a laboratory panel (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, SCr, glucose, and calcium) after she has been weaned off PN for ~36–48 hours. If she is unable to wean off PN in the next 4–5 days, earlier laboratory testing may be warranted. Monitoring laboratory values after being weaned from PN will give the team an idea of whether she truly needs additional enteral sodium supplementation to grow adequately while receiving breast milk. Another potential option to assess sodium status may be a spot urine sodium assessment. Although this has been shown to be accurate only in surgical patients with ileostomies, it is considered a noninvasive assessment of total body sodium. It is important to note that urine sodium values are inaccurate while receiving diuretics such as furosemide.",GPT-5.2,gpt-5.2,rag_always,FAIL,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.14285714285714285,True,"Final answer:

**Potassium:** Hold for now. Current serum potassium is 4.4 mEq/L (normal), but urine output remains minimal (20 ml over 16.5 hours). Potassium should be added once normal kidney function and adequate urine output are established, typically starting Day 2-3 at 2-4 mEq/kg/day.

**Calcium:** Start at 2-4 mEq/kg/day. Current serum calcium is 8.9 mg/dL (low-normal for neonate). Begin with 2 mEq/kg/day initially.

**Phosphorus:** Start at 1-2 mmol/kg/day. Current serum phosphorus is 4.2 mg/dL (normal). Begin with 1 mmol/kg/day initially, can increase as needed.

**Magnesium:** Start at 0.3-0.5 mEq/kg/day. Current serum magnesium is 2.1 mg/dL (normal). Begin with 0.3 mEq/kg/day.

**Acetate/Chloride:** The patient has metabolic acidosis (CO2 17 mEq/L, chloride 116 mEq/L). Use acetate to help correct acid-base status and minimize chloride."
open_21,"Case context:
BBS is a Day of Life 2, 35-week gestational age neonate born prematurely via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 1625 yesterday. Apgar scores were 5 at one minute, 7 at five minutes, and 8 at ten minutes. He is currently on the ventilator under the radiant warmer. Gastroschisis was diagnosed in utero, and his bowel is currently in a silo. He had minimal urine output overnight, so he has received one 20 ml per kilogram bolus of 0.9 percent normal saline.
Pertinent Maternal History:
BBS was born to a 17-year-old girl, gravida 1, para 0. She reported taking cocaine early in pregnancy before she knew she was pregnant. She quit at 14 weeks gestational age, and her last toxicology screen was negative. Medications during pregnancy included prenatal vitamins. At her 19-week ultrasound, it was discovered that BBS had gastroschisis. The mother was admitted in preterm labor following premature spontaneous rupture of membranes. Prior to delivery, she received one dose of intramuscular betamethasone 12 milligrams and two grams of intravenous ampicillin.
Reason for Consult:
The consult was requested for PN because of a delay in receiving full enteral nutrition due to the patient’s gastroschisis. The gastroschisis is currently being managed with a silo in place.
Nutrition Problem:
The patient is unable to initiate full enteral nutrition to meet nutrition requirements.
Birth Weight: 2.115 kilograms (appropriate for gestational age based on the Fenton growth curve).
Length at Birth: 44 centimeters (appropriate for gestational age based on the Fenton growth curve).
Current Weight: 1.925 kilograms.
Weight Assessment: The patient has lost approximately 9 percent of birth weight on Day of Life 2.
Nutrition Goals:
PN alone fluid goal: 120 to 130 ml per kilogram per day.
With enteral nutrition fluid goal: 140 to 150 ml per kilogram per day.
Protein goal: 4 grams per kilogram per day.
Parenteral caloric goal: 100 to 110 kilocalories per kilogram per day.
Enteral caloric goal: 120 to 130 kilocalories per kilogram per day.
Diet: The patient is receiving nothing enterally. The mother does not plan to breastfeed.
IV Access: Peripheral venous access.
IV Fluids: D10W at 7 ml per hour.
Medications: Intravenous ampicillin 211.5 milligrams every 8 hours and intravenous gentamicin 10.6 milligrams every 24 hours.
Fluid Intake and Output Assessment at approximately 16.5 hours of life:
Intake: 161 ml total.
Oral: none.
OG or NG: none.
IV: 161 ml (consisting of 116 ml IV fluid and 45 ml normal saline bolus).
Output: 50 ml total.
Urine: 20 ml.
NG or G-tube: 20 ml.
Drains: 10 ml from gauze around the silo.
Ostomy: none.
Stool: none yet.
Abdomen: Unable to adequately assess because the bowel is in the silo.
Laboratory Test Results:
Sodium: 136 mEq/L.
Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L.
Chloride: 116 mEq/L.
Carbon dioxide: 17 mEq/L.
Glucose: 112 mg/dl.

Question:
Assess and determine electrolyte additives.","Phosphorus is initiated as sodium phosphate at 0.5 mmol/kg/d, while potassium phosphate is not included. Potassium is not added in the first customized PN solution. Specifically, potassium acetate is none and potassium chloride is none.
Sodium is provided because the addition of sodium in the first customized PN solution is usually based on what is considered standard IV fluids for a DOL 2 neonate. To provide a total of 2 mEq/kg/d sodium, an additional sodium acetate of 1.3 mEq/kg/d is selected. Sodium chloride is none.
Magnesium is not added because BGJ’s magnesium is currently elevated at 2.7 mg/dl after receiving 4 g of IV magnesium sulfate during delivery for neuroprotection. Therefore, magnesium sulfate is none.

Question:
What other additives would you include in the first patient-specific PN order?","Common additives in neonatal PN solutions include the following:
a. Cysteine: Cysteine is a conditionally essential amino acid in neonates and infants because of the enzymatic immaturity of the transsulfuration pathway responsible for conversion of methionine to cysteine and then ultimately taurine. Cysteine is not found in commercially available amino acid products because of stability concerns. The addition of cysteine provides an added benefit of decreasing the pH of the PN solution further to allow for improved calcium and phosphate solubility. For this reason, some institutions add cysteine to PN at a ratio of 40 mg for every gram of amino acids.
b. Heparin: Heparin is typically added at 0.25–1 unit/ml of PN solution for solutions infusing through central venous catheters (CVCs). In neonates, this process maintains the patency of the catheter, given the extremely low flow rates of these solutions and the small diameter of the catheter. Some institutions will consider removal of heparin from these solutions if the flow rate is sufficient to maintain the patency of the catheter (eg, 10 ml/h).
c. Carnitine: Carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for oxidation and energy production and is an important addition to PN solutions for patients <32 weeks’ GA. Carnitine accrual occurs almost exclusively during the third trimester of pregnancy, so extremely premature neonates who are not receiving adequate EN are at risk for deficiency without supplementation. Carnitine is typically added to PN solutions at 5–20 mg/kg/d if no enteral intake of human breast milk or formula is provided and especially if the infant is expected to be on PN longer than 14 days.
d. Multivitamins: Pediatric multivitamins should be included in customized PN solutions at 2 ml/kg/d for infants <2.5 kg and 5 ml/d for infants ≥2.5 kg.
e. Trace elements: None of the currently commercially available multi–trace-element products contain the appropriate amounts of each of the standard trace elements. For this reason, the ASPEN Novel Nutrient Task Force recommendations6 for pediatric trace elements in this population is to add them as individual components as follows (see also Appendix B, Table B-25). Note that more recent European recommendations supported by ASPEN recommend slightly higher doses of zinc (500 mcg/kg/d), copper (40 mcg/kg/d), and selenium (7 mcg/kg/d) in premature infants.7 These higher amounts are starting to be used in clinical practice in the United States:

i.   Zinc: 400 mcg/kg/d (if weight is <3000 g)
ii.  Copper: 20 mcg/kg/d
iii. Manganese: 1 mcg/kg/d (Note that some groups do not add manganese because of manganese contamination from other PN components, the risks of toxicity, and the lack of deficiency observed in patients.)
 iv. Selenium: 2 mcg/kg/d
  v. No addition of chromium",GPT-5.2,gpt-5.2,no_rag,PASS,0.9,1.0,,,True,"Final answer:
- Pediatric/neonatal multivitamin: 2 mL/kg/day (max 5 mL/day)  
- Trace elements: zinc 400 mcg/kg/day, copper 20 mcg/kg/day, manganese 1 mcg/kg/day, selenium 2 mcg/kg/day  
- Levocarnitine 10 mg/kg/day  
- Sodium acetate (instead of chloride) to help correct metabolic acidosis; avoid additional sodium chloride at this time  
- Phosphate (as sodium or potassium phosphate) to support Ca/Phos balance and bone mineralization (dose per Ca/Phos solubility and serum levels)  
- Do not add potassium on DOL 2 given K 5.2 mEq/L; reassess daily  
- Lipid injectable emulsion (with heparin per NICU practice): start 1 g/kg/day and advance as tolerated (adds essential fatty acids and non-dextrose calories)"

Her total output was 23 ml plus one stool. This included 20 ml of urine and 3 ml from the NG/G-tube. There were no drains, no ostomy output, and stool was passed once.
On abdominal examination, her abdomen was round and soft with positive bowel sounds.
Her most recent laboratory results are as follows:
Sodium: 128 mEq/L
Potassium: 4.7 mEq/L
Chloride: 100 mEq/L
Carbon dioxide: 24 mEq/L
Glucose: 115 mg/dl
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 37 mg/dl
Serum creatinine (SCr): 0.7 mg/dl
Calcium: 9.2 mg/dl
Phosphorus: 5.1 mg/dl
Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dl
Triglycerides (TGs): 187 mg/dl
Total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dl
Albumin: 2.8 g/dl

Question:
Assess and determine electrolyte additives.","Phosphorus: Phosphorus remains WNL. Advance sodium phosphate to the recommended amount of 1 mmol/kg/d.
Sodium phosphate: 1 mmol/kg/d
Potassium phosphate: None
Potassium: BGJ’s potassium is WNL and is most likely lower than the actual laboratory result. This is related to BGJ now needing to have blood collected via heel sticks, given the loss of her UAC. These samples are often hemolyzed, which falsely elevates the potassium level. (Note that most laboratories indicate hemolysis of the sample within the result comments.) Given this normal value, the potential for a hemolyzed sample, and BGJ’s adequate urine output (~1.6 ml/kg/h), BGJ’s potassium in her PN solution should be increased to the standard provision of 2 mEq/kg/d. However, given BGJ’s current decreased chloride value and increased carbon dioxide value, changing from potassium acetate to potassium chloride would be recommended. Therefore, potassium should be provided as 2 mEq/kg/d potassium chloride.
Potassium acetate: None
Potassium chloride: 2 mEq/kg/d
Sodium: Premature infants have increased rates of sodium clearance via their urine. Additionally, they have increased sodium needs, which are not meet by breast milk. Given BGJ’s decreased sodium level, the recommendation would be to increase her total sodium to 3–4 mEq/kg/d. By increasing the sodium phosphate in the PN script, 1.33 mEq/kg/d sodium is provided by the provision of 1 mmol/kg/d sodium phosphate. The remaining 1.7–2.7 mEq/kg/d sodium should come from either sodium chloride or sodium acetate. Given BGJ’s decreased chloride value and improved carbon dioxide value, adding some sodium chloride would be appropriate, but one should not remove all the sodium acetate because premature infants have increased losses of acetate due to renal excretion.9 For this reason, the recommendation would be to provide sodium acetate at 1.3 mEq/kg/d and to add 1.4 mEq/kg/d sodium chloride to provide a total of 4 mEq/kg/d sodium.
Sodium acetate: 1.3 mEq/kg/d
Sodium chloride: 1.4 mEq/kg/d
Magnesium: Given BGJ’s decreased magnesium level and the lack of magnesium in her current PN solution, magnesium should be added at the standard amount of 0.3 mEq/kg/d.
Magnesium sulfate: 0.3 mEq/kg/d
Calcium: BGJ’s calcium value is WNL and should be advanced to the recommended amount of 2 mEq/kg/d.
Calcium gluconate: 2 mEq/kg/d",Claude Sonnet 4.5,claude-sonnet,rag_gated,FAIL,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.0,True,"Final answer:

Based on BGJ's laboratory results, the following electrolyte adjustments are recommended:

**Sodium:** Increase sodium acetate and/or sodium chloride to address hyponatremia (current 128 mEq/L, goal 135-145 mEq/L). Consider 3-4 mEq/kg/day total sodium.

**Potassium:** Continue current potassium supplementation at approximately 2 mEq/kg/day (potassium is 4.7 mEq/L, within normal range).

**Chloride:** Adjust chloride based on sodium correction needs, maintaining chloride:acetate ratio appropriate for acid-base balance (current chloride 100 mEq/L is acceptable).

**Calcium:** Continue current calcium supplementation (calcium 9.2 mg/dl is within normal range for neonate).

**Phosphorus:** Continue current phosphorus supplementation (phosphorus 5.1 mg/dl is within normal range).

**Magnesium:** Continue current magnesium supplementation (magnesium 1.7 mg/dl is within normal range).

Primary concern is the hyponatremia requiring sodium supplementation increase in the PN formulation."
open_9,"Case context:
In the past 48 hours, BGJ has received an increase in her enteral nutrition, which consists of mother’s breast milk (MBM) with a backup of donor breast milk (DBM). Her umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) and umbilical venous catheter (UVC) have been removed, and a single-lumen peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line has been placed in her right upper extremity. The tip of the PICC has been confirmed as central by x-ray. BGJ has been receiving the initial parenteral nutrition (PN) prescription that was written two days ago, and repeat laboratory tests were conducted this morning.
A PICC line was placed in the right upper extremity after the removal of the UAC and UVC. BGJ continues to receive caffeine, but her antibiotics were discontinued after her initial blood culture remained negative at 36 hours. There have been no changes in her IV fluids. She began receiving breast milk at 1 ml every 3 hours, and today this will be advanced to 1.5 ml every 3 hours.
Her current weight is 0.510 kg.
Over the past 24 hours, BGJ’s total fluid intake was 54.1 ml. She has not taken any oral feeds. Her orogastric/nasogastric intake was 8 ml, given as 1 ml every 3 hours. Her intravenous intake totaled 46.1 ml, which consisted of 40.8 ml of PN and 5.3 ml of ILE.

Question:
What other additives would you include in this PN order?",None in addition to what has already been added,GPT-5.2,gpt-5.2,no_rag,FAIL,0.3,1.0,,,True,"Final answer:
- Pediatric multivitamin infusion: 2 mL/kg/day added to PN (central line)
- Trace elements: hold for now given weight 0.510 kg (add when ≥3 kg or if prolonged PN per NICU protocol)
- Heparin: 0.5 units/mL to maintain PICC patency (institution-dependent)
- Carnitine: 8–10 mg/kg/day if expected prolonged PN (≥2–4 weeks) or if cholestasis risk increases
- No additional electrolytes as “additives” (Ca/Phos/Mg already present; monitor/adjust separately)"
